False,methotrexate mtx sulfasalazine ssz cyclosporine csa widely used dmards treatment psa safe effective patients active peripheral arthritis although appear effective axial manifestationsnan,12463452,sulfasalazine/SSZ,PsA,"As erosive and deforming arthritis is present in 40% of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), early and aggressive treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be as effective in controlling the progression of the disease as it is for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), and cyclosporine (CsA) are the most widely used DMARDs in the treatment of PsA and are safe and effective in patients with active peripheral arthritis, although they do not appear to be effective on axial manifestations. No controlled study has evaluated the efficacy of these drugs on the progression of radiological damage. It has recently been demonstrated that leflunomide and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are effective in PsA and psoriasis. The symptomatic improvement has been important and sustained and side effects minimal. In particular, inhibitors of TNF appear to have excellent potential to treat PsA. These agents are able to slow joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis and they are effective on spinal symptoms in ankylosing spondylitis. Hopefully, these findings will prove true in PsA as well."
True,polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs persistent environmental toxicants present ofus adults dosedependently associated obesity nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld nan,24812009,Polychlorinated biphenyls/PCBs,NAFLD/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent environmental toxicants, present in 100% of U.S. adults and dose-dependently associated with obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). PCBs are predicted to interact with receptors previously implicated in xenobiotic/energy metabolism and NAFLD. These receptors include the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), liver-X-receptor (LXRα), and farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR). This study evaluates Aroclor 1260, a PCB mixture with congener composition mimicking that of human adipose tissue, and selected congeners, as potential ligands for these receptors utilizing human hepatoma-derived (HepG2) and primate-derived (COS-1) cell lines, and primary human hepatocytes. Aroclor 1260 (20 μg/ml) activated AhR, and PCB 126, a minor component, was a potent inducer. Aroclor 1260 activated PXR in a simple concentration-dependent manner at concentrations ≥10 μg/ml. Among the congeners tested, PCBs 138, 149, 151, 174, 183, 187, and 196 activated PXR. Aroclor 1260 activated CAR2 and CAR3 variants at lower concentrations and antagonize CAR2 activation by the CAR agonist, CITCO, at higher concentrations (≥20 μg/ml). Additionally, Aroclor 1260 induced CYP2B6 in primary hepatocytes. At subtoxic doses, Aroclor 1260 did not activate LXR or FXR and had no effect on LXR- or FXR-dependent induction by the agonists T0901317 or GW4064, respectively. Aroclor 1260 (20 μg/ml) suppressed PPARα activation by the agonist nafenopin, although none of the congeners tested demonstrated significant inhibition. The results suggest that Aroclor 1260 is a human AhR, PXR and CAR3 agonist, a mixed agonist/antagonist for CAR2, and an antagonist for human PPARα. "
True,although pcp classified human carcinogen epidemiological observations suggest exposure chlorophenols general pcp solutions particular may result increased risk certain malignant disorders nasal carcinoma soft tissue sarcoma nan,7904464,PCP,sarcoma,"Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was, and still is, one of the most frequently used fungicides and pesticides. Its toxicity is due to interference with oxidative phosphorylation. Acute and chronic poisoning may occur by dermal absorption, inhalation or ingestion. Chronic poisoning occurs mainly in sawmill workers or people living in log homes treated with PCP-containing wood protecting formulations. Quantitative determination of PCP in urine and serum is useful to detect occupational or subclinical exposure. The clinical features of acute and chronic PCP poisoning can be classified systematically into effects on the skin, metabolism (fever), the haematopoietic tissue, the respiratory system, the central and peripheral nervous system, the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract. Although PCP is not classified as a human carcinogen, some epidemiological observations suggest that exposure to chlorophenols in general and PCP solutions in particular may result in an increased risk for certain malignant disorders such as nasal carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma. There is concern that contamination of PCP-solutions with products such as chlorodibenzo-p-dioxins is the real cause of this suspected carcinogenicity. No specific antidote exists for the treatment of (acute) PCP poisoning. The basis of the treatment of acute poisoning is intensive supportive care with prevention of dangerous rise in temperature. Use of PCP-based products as indoor wood preservatives poses an unacceptable risk to human health."

False,rosiglitazone significantly increased glucose uptake wild type podocytes associated translocation glut plasma membranenan,19533082,Rosiglitazone,type,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma agonists are used increasingly in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the context of renal disease, PPARgamma agonists reduce microalbuminuria in diabetic nephropathy; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown. Glomerular podocytes are newly characterised insulin-sensitive cells and there is good evidence that they are targeted in diabetic nephropathy. In this study we investigated the functional and molecular effects of the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone on human podocytes."
False,median mpa concentration  microgml patients within range respectively nan,16359376,MPA,MPA,"Therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolic acid (MPA) in combination with cyclosporine 2-h concentration (CsA C2, n = 68) or tacrolimus trough concentration (n = 10) was investigated by repeated measurements of MPA and MPA-glucuronide (MPAG) trough concentrations in renal allograft recipients during the first 3 months post-transplant. The acute rejection rate was lower (19% vs. 43%; P < 0.05) in patients achieving CsA C2 target range during the first week (1600-2000 microg/l), n = 26, compared with those who did not, n = 42. Median MPA concentration was 0.9 and 1.2 microg/ml in patients within or below C2 range, respectively (P = 0.19). CsA C2 correlated with MPAG-to-MPA ratio (P < 0.01, r = 0.91) and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT, P < 0.01, r = 0.86). Total MPA concentration increased during the 3 months, but not in patients on tacrolimus. High CsA C2 lowered the acute rejection rate and plasma MPA. High CsA C2 is associated with elevated GGT, probably because of cholestatic effects, which explain the increased MPAG-to-MPA ratio. Increasing MPA concentration is ascribed to per-protocol CsA C2 reductions. In conclusion, CsA may confound the relationship between MPA and the incidence of rejection, and contribute to the difficulty of obtaining a therapeutic range for MPA in clinical practice."
False,tumor growth inhibition tc tumor growth delay tc log kill auristatin pe dolastatin  days  days respectivelynan,10402249,auristatin PE,Tumor,"Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is an uncommon lymphoproliferative disease which remains incurable with current treatment protocols. We have previously established a permanent WM cell line, WSU-WM, which grows as a xenograft in severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of auristatin PE (a structural modification of the marine, shell-less mollusk peptide constituent dolastatin 10). WSU-WM cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 at a concentration of 2x10(5) cells/ml using 24-well plates. Auristatin PE or dolastatin 10 were added to triplicate wells and cell count and viability were assessed after 24, 48 and 72 h. Results showed that both agents were active against WSU-WM, and were able to induce complete growth inhibition at 100 pg/ml. The efficacy of these agents in vivo was evaluated using the WSU-WM SCID mouse xenograft model. Auristatin PE and dolastatin 10 were given i.v. via tail vein at 2.0 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively. The agents were given every second day for three injections which represent the maximum tolerated doses. Tumor growth inhibition (T/C), tumor growth delay (T-C), and log10 kill for auristatin PE and dolastatin 10 were 0%, 18 days, 2.83 and 67%, 2 days, 0.06, respectively. Based on these animal results, dolastatin 10 was inactive while auristatin PE was highly active. We therefore focused further investigation on auristatin PE to understand some of its mechanisms of action. Using two flow cytometry assays, propidium iodide for cell cycle analysis and 7-amino actinomycin D (7AAD) to detect apoptosis, we were able to demonstrate that auristatin PE at 10 pg/ml after 24 h arrested 50% of WSU-MW cells in G2M. Concomitantly, 31% of auristatin PE-treated cells entered apoptosis. By 72 h, greater than 75% of the cells became apoptotic. The activity of auristatin PE should be evaluated in other tumor types and in clinical trials."
False,inflammatory hypersensitivity reactions restylane occurrednan,24529939,Restylane,hypersensitivity,"Restylane is a relatively new material being used for temporary vocal fold medialization. Few studies have evaluated the safety, complication rate, and length of benefit derived from Restylane injection medialization.

True,systemic toxicity may occur following ingestion chromium(vi) salt chromium(vi) induced skin burns inhalation chromium(vi) occurring occupationallynan,10382555,chromium(VI),skin burns,"Repeated topical exposure to chromium(VI) may cause an allergic contact dermatitis or the formation of chrome ulcers. Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III)."
True,numerous clinical trials utilizing various types lipids including fish oil short chain fatty acids suggest fats play important role inflammatory response characterizes inflammatory bowel disease nan,17545776,fatty acids,inflammatory bowel disease,"Nutrition plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and treatment of the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In addition, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are often found to have nutrient deficiencies at the time of diagnosis, whereas others develop features of malnutrition over the course of their illness. Therefore, an understanding of the relationship between nutrients and inflammatory bowel disease is important if these patients are to receive optimal care."

False, patients chronic haemodialysis hd serum phosphate level mgdl mmoll recently recommended appropriate target patients endstage renal disease esrd nan,12817070,phosphate,ESRD/end-stage renal disease,"More than 60% of patients on chronic haemodialysis (HD) have a serum phosphate level above 5.5 mg/dl (1.75 mmol/l), which recently has been recommended as an appropriate target in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Preventing hyperphosphataemia and elevated Ca x P product not only ameliorates the progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone disease, but also appears to reduce cardio-vascular morbidity and mortality from vascular calcifications. Dietary phosphate restriction and the administration of aluminium and calcium salts have been the principal means of phosphate control over the last decade. Unfortunately, the protean disturbances of toxic aluminium accumulation in the body virtually eliminated aluminium from clinical practice. Calcium-based therapy, although well tolerated, results in frequent hypercalcaemia when administered concurrently with vitamin D analogues, despite a decrease in the concentration of dialysate calcium. Sevelamer (Renagel((R))) has been a novel, non-absorbable calcium- and aluminium-free synthetic polymer. In initial studies, sevelamer reduced serum phosphate, Ca x P product and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in a manner comparable with calcium acetate therapy. However, the effect on PTH levels may prove to be inconsistent. It seems somewhat less effective in binding phosphate than aluminium, although no direct comparisons have been made. In a recent study, it attenuated the progression of vascular calcification in HD patients. It also binds bile acids, resulting in substantially lower low-density lipo-protein cholesterol levels. The major obstacle to its current use is a substantial increase in the cost associated with sevelamer therapy."

False,use heparin extracorporeal therapies problematical due haemorrhagic complications consequence heparinase flavobacterium heparinum used determination plasma heparin elimination heparin circulationnan,8615834,heparin,haemorrhagic,"The use of heparin for extracorporeal therapies has been problematical due to haemorrhagic complications; as a consequence, heparinase I from Flavobacterium heparinum is used for the determination of plasma heparin and for elimination of heparin from circulation. Here we report the expression of recombinant heparinase I in Escherichia coli, purification to homogeneity and characterization of the purified enzyme. Heparinase I was expressed with an N-terminal histidine tag. The enzyme was insoluble and inactive, but could be refolded, and was purified to homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography. The cumulative yield was 43%, and the recovery of purified heparinase I was 14.4 mg/l of culture. The N-terminal sequence and the molecular mass as analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption MS were consistent with predictions from the heparinase I gene structure. The reverse-phase HPLC profile of the tryptic digest, the Michaelis-Menten constant Km (47 micrograms/ml) and the specific activity (117 units/mg) of purified recombinant heparinase I were similar to those of the native enzyme. Degradation of heparin by heparinase I results in a characteristic product distribution, which is different from those obtained by degradation with heparinase II or III from F. heparinum. We developed a rapid anion-exchange HPLC method to separate the products of enzymic heparin degradation, using POROS perfusion chromatography media. Separation of characteristic di-, tetra- and hexa-saccharide products is performed in 10 min. These methods for the expression, purification and analysis of recombinant heparinase I may facilitate further development of heparinase I-based medical therapies as well as further investigation of the structures of heparin and heparan sulphate and their role in the extracellular matrix."
False,patients discontinue mp aza laboratory abnormalities improved spontaneously dose reductionnan,18266236,AZA,laboratory abnormalities,6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug azathioprine (AZA) are effective for the induction and maintenance of remission and reduction of corticosteroid exposure for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The standard dose of 6-MP is 1.0-1.5 mg/kg/day and for AZA is 2.0-2.5 mg/kg/day. The aim of this study was to determine whether IBD patients 6 years of age and younger require higher than standard doses of 6-MP/AZA to achieve clinical remission.

This case report highlights a rare cause of a chemical burn that could become more common with increasing use of traditional remedies worldwide. "
True,supersensitivity noradrenaline contributes certain vascular disorders eg hypertension chronic neuropathic pain conditions eg complex regional pain syndromenan,11474550,noradrenaline,hypertension,"Supersensitivity to noradrenaline contributes to certain vascular disorders (e.g., hypertension) and chronic neuropathic pain conditions (e.g., complex regional pain syndrome). We aimed to develop a procedure for inducing adrenergic supersensitivity that could be used to investigate the role of catecholamines in these clinical conditions. In the first study, three doses of guanethidine were administered by iontophoresis to separate small patches of skin in the forearm of healthy human volunteers. Four to five hours later. the vasoconstrictor response to the adrenergic releasing agent tyramine was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by iontophoretic pretreatment with guanethidine, indicating that guanethidine had depleted endogenous adrenergic stores. In a second study, guanethidine and saline were administered by iontophoresis four times over approximately 2 weeks at separate sites in the forearm. One to two days after the final pretreatment, vasoconstriction to the iontophoresis of a weak dose of noradrenaline was enhanced at sites pretreated with guanethidine. To investigate the effect of guanethidine pretreatment on thermal hyperalgesia. the experimental sites were sensitized to heat by the topical application of 0.6% capsaicin. Both before and after the application of capsaicin, the heat-pain threshold and heat-pain ratings to suprathreshold stimulation were similar at sites pretreated for 2 weeks with guanethidine or saline. However, after the iontophoresis of noradrenaline, thermal hyperalgesia was greater at the guanethidine-pretreated site than the saline pretreated site. These observations indicate that prolonged depletion of adrenergic stores by guanethidine induces adrenergic supersensitivity in cutaneous vessels, and that adrenergic supersensitivity enhances thermal hyperalgesia in the presence of noradrenaline."
True, patients receiving leuprolide weight gain kgnan,7516978,leuprolide,weight gain,"The luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist leuprolide was investigated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study comprising 50 evaluable patients with moderate to severe symptoms resulting from benign prostatic hyperplasia. Patients received 3.75 mg. leuprolide depot or placebo as an injection every 28 days for 24 weeks. Hemoglobin level decreased by 0.8 gm/100 ml. (p = 0.0052) for patients receiving leuprolide. Mean testicular volume decreased by 28.9% (p < 0.001) compared to placebo. Of 26 patients receiving leuprolide 5 had a weight gain of more than 3 kg. Almost all patients receiving leuprolide experienced hot flushes. Breast changes, and loss of energy and vigor were not more pronounced than for patients receiving placebo. Erectile function and sexual activity were lost during treatment. Libido also decreased but was still partially retained. Despite this, patients receiving leuprolide were generally contented with their sexual life during treatment. Side effects were bothersome for some patients but were reversible. Of the patients in our study 73% expressed that they could repeat or continue treatment if that had been possible. The high cost of these drugs will limit their use for a benign condition, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia."
True,however mechanisms myocardial ischemia induced epinephrine significantly different exercisenan,3413271,epinephrine,myocardial ischemia,"The role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial ischemia was examined in patients with coronary artery disease. Objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise. Both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial ischemia as evidenced by ST segment depression and angina. However, the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exercise. Exercise-induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while epinephrine-induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product. These findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine, as may occur during states of emotional distress, has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion."
True,animal studies suggested skin exposure isocyanates may important risk factor respiratory sensitization leading asthma nan,10642416,isocyanates,asthma,Little is known about the extent of human isocyanate skin exposure in auto body shops and the effectiveness of personal protective equipment. Animal studies have suggested that skin exposure to isocyanates may be an important risk factor for respiratory sensitization leading to asthma.

However, only about 30% of breast cancers are estrogen-dependent and can be treated by hormonal manipulation. New therapeutic approaches combining estrogen ablation therapy with other compounds must be explored. Various studies suggest that bombesin or gastrin-releasing peptide acts as an autocrine growth factor and may play a role in the initiation and progression of some cancers, including that of the breast."
False,twentyone consecutive cancer patients morphineinduced delirium underwent opioid rotation fentanyl nan,16043013,fentanyl,cancer,"Although recent studies suggest that opioid rotation could be an effective treatment strategy for morphine-induced delirium, there have been no prospective studies to investigate the treatment effects of opioid rotation using fentanyl. The primary aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in symptom palliation of morphine-induced delirium. Twenty-one consecutive cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium underwent opioid rotation to fentanyl. Physicians recorded the symptom severity of delirium (the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, MDAS), pain, and other symptoms (categorical verbal scale from 0: none to 3: severe) and the Schedule for Team Assessment Scale (STAS) (from 0: none to 4: extreme); and performance status at the time of study enrollment and three and seven days after. Of 21 patients recruited, one patient did not complete the study. In the remaining 20 patients, morphine was substituted with transdermal fentanyl in 9 patients and parenteral fentanyl in 11 patients. Total opioid dose increased from 64 mg oral morphine equivalent/day (Day 0) to 98 mg/day (Day 7), and the median increase in total opioid dose was 42%. Treatment success, defined as an MDAS score below 10 and pain score of 2 or less, was obtained in 13 patients on Day 3 and 18 patients on Day 7. The mean MDAS score significantly decreased from 14 (Day 0) to 6.4 and 3.6 (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Pain scores significantly decreased from 2.2 (Day 0) to 1.3 and 1.1 on the categorical verbal scale (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001); from 2.6 (Day 0) to 1.6 and 1.3 on the STAS (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Symptom scores of dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting significantly decreased, and performance status significantly improved. Opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl may be effective in alleviating delirium and pain in cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium."
True,reversible hearing loss known complication following administration quinine salicylates nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs erythromycinnan,9270425,salicylates,hearing loss,"Reversible and irreversible ototoxicity has been documented following the administration of various therapeutic agents. Reversible hearing loss is a known complication following the administration of quinine, salicylates and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and erythromycin. We report a case of reversible hearing loss following OKT3 (murine monoclonal antibody CD3) administration. OKT3, a monoclonal antibody used as an immunosuppressant following cadaveric renal transplants, was associated with a transient sensorineural hearing loss that reversed following discontinuation of OKT3."

False,blockade reninangiotensin aldosterone system proven effective retarding progression renal disease remnant kidney model well experimental diseases importantly range progressive human renal diseasesnan,11709805,aldosterone,diseases,"Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has proven effective in retarding progression of renal disease in the remnant kidney model, as well as other experimental diseases, and, most importantly, in a range of progressive human renal diseases. Attention has focused on the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in propagating progression both by its hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic actions. Recent evidence, predominately in the remnant kidney model, indicates that the drugs used to block this hormone system, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, also lower aldosterone levels. Thus, aldosterone, as well as angiotensin II, appears to be instrumental in sustaining the hypertension and fibroproliferative destruction of the residual kidney."
True,low dose aspirin asa use associated wide range adverse side effects upper gastrointestinal gi tract range troublesome symptoms without mucosal lesions serious toxicity including ulcers gi bleeding perforation even deathnan,22542152,aspirin,ulcers,"Low dose aspirin (ASA) use has been associated with a wide range of adverse side effects in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which range from troublesome symptoms without mucosal lesions to more serious toxicity, including ulcers, GI bleeding, perforation and even death. Upper GI symptoms in low dose ASA users are common but often careless or misinterpreted and they are not always related to the presence of mucosal injury. Usually, low dose ASA related ulcers are reasonably small and asymptomatic, and probably heal over a period of weeks to a few months. But, the real clinical problem occurs when the ulcer results in a GI complication (mostly bleeding). The estimated average excess risk of symptomatic or complicated ulcer related to low dose ASA is five cases per 1000 ASA users per year. Death is the worst outcome of GI complications in low dose ASA users, but data about this aspect are scarce. Current evidence indicates that low dose ASA can damage the lower GI tract also, but the real size of the problem is still unknown."
True,steroids reported activate hypothalamic networks sexdifferentiated waynan,18056697,steroids,hypothalamic networks,"One working hypothesis behind transsexuality is that the normal sex differentiation of certain hypothalamic networks is altered. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the pattern of cerebral activation in 12 nonhomosexual male-to-female transsexuals (MFTRs) when smelling 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and estra-1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). These steroids are reported to activate the hypothalamic networks in a sex-differentiated way. Like in female controls the hypothalamus in MFTRs activated with AND, whereas smelling of EST engaged the amygdala and piriform cortex. Male controls, on the other hand, activated the hypothalamus with EST. However, when restricting the volume of interest to the hypothalamus activation was detected in MFTR also with EST, and explorative conjunctional analysis revealed that MFTR shared a hypothalamic cluster with women when smelling AND, and with men when smelling EST. Because the EST effect was limited, MFTR differed significantly only from male controls, and only for EST-AIR and EST-AND. These data suggest a pattern of activation away from the biological sex, occupying an intermediate position with predominantly female-like features. Because our MFTRs were nonhomosexual, the results are unlikely to be an effect of sexual practice. Instead, the data implicate that transsexuality may be associated with sex-atypical physiological responses in specific hypothalamic circuits, possibly as a consequence of a variant neuronal differentiation."
False,effects urinary albumin excretion renal function changes delapril manidipine normotensive type diabetic patients microalbuminurianan,11336083,manidipine,diabetic,"This study was designed to investigate the effect of delapril, an ACE inhibitor, and manidipine, a long action calcium antagonist, on persistent microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients. Sixty type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to take delapril 30 mg/day or manidipine 10 mg/day for 48 weeks, in an open label design. Twenty eight of thirty subjects in the delapril group and twenty nine of thirty in the manidipine group completed the study. Urine albumin excretion as measured by the urinary albumin creatinine ratio decreased significantly in both groups (112.0+/-60.9 to 95.3+/-64.9 mg/g and 108.5+/-51.0 to 96.4+/-53.5 mg/g in the delapril and manidipine group respectively, p < 0.05, by paired t-test). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly changed after treatment in the delapril group but significantly decreased in the manidipine group (130.9+/-7.1/80.2+/-6.1 to 127.2+/-7.1/78.0+/-5.3 mm/Hg, p < 0.05, by student's paired t-test). After 48 weeks of treatment, two patients in the delapril group and one patient in the manidipine group converted to normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) and one patient in each group progressed to overt nephropathy (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g). There were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, serum fructosamine, creatinine, potassium and lipid profiles after 48 weeks of treatment in both groups. Two cases in the delapril group were withdrawn during the study because of an intolerable cough and one case in the manidipine group because of intolerable dizziness and headache. In conclusion, both delapril and manidipine are effective in the reduction of microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria."

Western blot analysis showed that GM2E1, but not GMneo, expressed a protein that reacted with anti-human P450 2E1 antibody. The 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase,p-nitrophenol hydroxylase, and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) demethylase activities of the P450 in these cells were measured in monolayer cell cultures without preparing microsomes. Exposure of the GM2E1 cells to NDMA for 4 days caused severe decreases in cell viability, as determined by crystal violet uptake, and showed a sigmoidal dose-response curve with a median lethal dose of 17 microM. In contrast, the viability of GMneo cells was not altered by NDMA even at concentrations up to 10 mM. Time- and concentration-dependent methylation of DNA, RNA and protein by [14C]NDMA was only observed in cells expressing P450 2E1. Inhibitors of P450 2E1 activity such as ethanol, 4-methylpyrazole, and isoniazid caused a 90% decrease in the methylation of cellular macromolecules and also completely protected the cells against NDMA-mediated toxicity. The cytotoxicity due to exposure to NDMA was partially inhibited by antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole and N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone but was not potentiated upon glutathione depletion. These results document the ability of rat P450 2E1 to metabolize NDMA to toxic reactive intermediates and demonstrate that this cell line provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of metabolism-mediated toxicity and carcinogenesis."
True,nicotine wellknown unpleasant side effects eg transient dizziness nausea nicotine induced nystagmus ninnan,17990061,Nicotine,nausea,"Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."
False,modulating effect recombinant human interferon alpha ifnalpha antitumor efficacy 5-fluorouracil 5-fu human carcinoma cell lines investigated vitro vivonan,8074466,5-FU/5-fluorouracil,carcinoma,"The modulating effect of recombinant human interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) on the antitumor efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) against human carcinoma cell lines was investigated in vitro and in vivo. 5-FU, fluorouridine (FUR) or fluoro-5'-deoxyuridine (FUdR) were tested against cultured human colon tumor C-1 cells with or without IFN-alpha. The in vitro antitumor activity of 5-FU was enhanced by the addition of IFN-alpha, but IFN-alpha did not increase the effect of FUR or FUdR. The in vivo antitumor activity of 5-FU with or without IFN-alpha was assessed using Co-4, a human colon carcinoma xenograft, in nude mice. Thymidylate synthetase inhibition and concentration of FUR in the treated tumor tissues were concomitantly measured. A synergistic effect of 5-FU and IFN-alpha was observed on Co-4 in nude mice, and this in vivo synergism was obtained without any increment of thymidylate synthetase inhibition or side effects in terms of death rate and body weight loss. The intratumoral concentration of FUR was significantly increased by the addition of IFN-alpha in Co-4 tumor tissue treated with 5-FU. These results suggest that the mechanism of the combined effect of 5-FU and IFN-alpha is not related to enhancement of thymidylate synthetase inhibition, but to an increase of FUR concentration in the target tumor tissue. It is expected that this combination method will be clinically useful for the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinoma."

Prompted by a case of clozapine-related pericarditis in an adolescent, we undertook a retrospective chart review to discover whether any unrecognized cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy were among the children, adolescents, and young adults we had treated with clozapine. The sample comprised a total of 36 patients, who were monitored regularly over a period ranging from 2.5 to 79 months. The average observation period was 7.5 months. Patients were assessed for potential indicators of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. In more than 66% of all patients, at least one of several parameters potentially indicative of pericarditis, myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy was abnormal in at least one instance during the observation period. In all cases in which abnormalities were discovered, the abnormalities were found to be unspecific for myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. With the exception of the case which prompted our study, none of the patients were found to have developed any such disorder in the course of further treatment with clozapine."

True,hand mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsions evoked carbachol eserine significantly changed calcium chloridenan,6892185,carbachol,mydriasis,"The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."

In those who failed to respond, a second trial of therapy with one of the other two drugs was initiated, after omitting the first drug. A second failure of therapy was taken as an indication to use ciprofloxacin singly. Eventually, 18 (64.3%) cases responded to chloramphenicol or amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole. Ciprofloxacin was used in 19(35.7%) cases. the failure rate of treatment with chloramphenicol was 50%, with amoxycillin 71.4%, with co-trimoxazole 75% and 0% with ciprofloxacin. An analysis of the 28 cases revealed that apart from fever (in 100%), splenomegaly (in 82.1%) was the most important clinical pointer to diagnosis, along with absolute eosinopenia (in 71.4%). There were no major complications, except 2 cases with typhoid hepatitis who responded to choramphenicol and co-trimoxazole, respectively. Blood culture grew Salmonella typhi in 7 cases, of which 5 (72%) were multidrug resistant S. typhi. There were no characteristic clinical features to identify multi-drug resistant typhoid fever."

False,eight single nucleotide polymorphisms snps slca genotyped aspirin intolerant asthma aia aspirin tolerant asthma ata patients korean ethnicitynan,20597903,aspirin,asthma,"Aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) occurs from asthma exacerbation after exposure to aspirin. However, the underlying mechanisms of AIA occurrence are still unclear. The critical role of the solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, betaine/GABA) member 12 (SLC6A12) gene in GABAergic transmission, which is associated with mucus production in asthma, makes it a candidate gene for AIA association study. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLC6A12 were genotyped in 163 aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) and 429 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) patients of Korean ethnicity. Associations between polymorphisms of SLC6A12 and AIA were analysed using multivariate logistic analysis. Results showed that two polymorphisms and a haplotype in SLC6A12, rs499368 (P= 0.005; P(corr)= 0.03), rs557881 (non-synonymous C10R, P= 0.007; P(corr)= 0.04), and SLC6A12_BL1_ht1 (P= 0.009; P(corr)= 0.05) respectively, were significantly associated with AIA after multiple testing corrections. In addition, SNPs of SLC6A12 were significantly associated with the fall rate of FEV(1) by aspirin provocation suggesting that SLC6A12 could affect reversibility of lung function abnormalities in AIA patients. Although these results are preliminary and future replications are needed to confirm these findings, this study showed evidence of association between variants in SLC6A12 and AIA occurrence among asthmatics in a Korean population."
False,patients significant lung disease aviptadil tended improve oxygenationnan,18978135,aviptadil,lung disease,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) leads to an increased right ventricular workload, cardiac failure and death. In idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) the vasodilating vasoactive intestinal peptide (aviptadil) is deficient. The aim of the present study was to test the acute effects on haemodynamics and blood gases, and the safety, of a single dose of inhaled aviptadil in chronic PH. A total of 20 patients with PH (PAH in nine, PH in lung disease in eight and chronic thromboembolic PH in three) inhaled a single 100-microg dose of aviptadil during right-heart catheterisation. Haemodynamics and blood gases were measured. Aviptadil aerosol caused a small and temporary but significant selective pulmonary vasodilation, an improved stroke volume and mixed venous oxygen saturation. Overall, six patients experienced a pulmonary vascular resistance reduction of >20%. In patients with significant lung disease, aviptadil tended to improve oxygenation. The pulmonary vasodilating effect of aviptadil aerosol was modest and short-lived, did not cause any side-effects and led to a reduced workload of the right ventricle without affecting systemic blood pressure. Aviptadil inhalation tended to improve oxygenation in patients with significant lung disease. Further studies are needed to evaluate the full therapeutic potential of aviptadil aerosol, including higher doses and chronic treatment."

Current recommended treatment is largely supportive with careful fluid replacement, with no specific treatment available. Although corticosteroids are not mentioned in the WHO guidelines on the management of dengue, clinicians use corticosteroids empirically based on the presumed immunological basis of the complications of dengue. The evidence base for the benefit or lack of benefit of corticosteroids in dengue is limited; previous studies have been small, with methodological flaws, less stringent randomisation and unclear allocation concealment, and were performed a long time ago. Studies so far have only been in patients with shock syndrome, and the possible effects of corticosteroids on thrombocytopenia and bleeding as well as other complications of dengue are unknown. All previous studies have been in children; the effect of corticosteroid treatment in adults with dengue infection has not been evaluated. The possible beneficial effects of corticosteroids on the various manifestations of dengue infection need evaluation by adequately powered, well designed, randomised controlled trials."

True,recent years increasing evidence suggested messenger molecule nitric oxide  involved pain mechanisms migraine without aura naninvolved key word,10524660,nitric oxide/NO,migraine without aura,"Migraine with aura and migraine without aura have the same pain phase, thus indicating that migraine with aura and migraine without aura share a common pathway of nociception. In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide (NO) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura. In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura, in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura. The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and/or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced. Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls. Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject. Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008). In the controls, the GTN-induced headache gradually disappeared, whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion. At this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the International Headache Society. The results therefore suggest that NO is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura. Since cortical spreading depression has been shown to liberate NO in animals, this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading depression and headache in migraine with aura."

Sixty type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to take delapril 30 mg/day or manidipine 10 mg/day for 48 weeks, in an open label design. Twenty eight of thirty subjects in the delapril group and twenty nine of thirty in the manidipine group completed the study. Urine albumin excretion as measured by the urinary albumin creatinine ratio decreased significantly in both groups (112.0+/-60.9 to 95.3+/-64.9 mg/g and 108.5+/-51.0 to 96.4+/-53.5 mg/g in the delapril and manidipine group respectively, p < 0.05, by paired t-test). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly changed after treatment in the delapril group but significantly decreased in the manidipine group (130.9+/-7.1/80.2+/-6.1 to 127.2+/-7.1/78.0+/-5.3 mm/Hg, p < 0.05, by student's paired t-test). After 48 weeks of treatment, two patients in the delapril group and one patient in the manidipine group converted to normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) and one patient in each group progressed to overt nephropathy (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g). There were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, serum fructosamine, creatinine, potassium and lipid profiles after 48 weeks of treatment in both groups. Two cases in the delapril group were withdrawn during the study because of an intolerable cough and one case in the manidipine group because of intolerable dizziness and headache. In conclusion, both delapril and manidipine are effective in the reduction of microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria."

True,inhibition platelet activating factor pafinduced aggregation human thrombocytes ginkgolides considerations possible bleeding complications oral intake ginkgo biloba extractsnan,15693702,ginkgolides,bleeding complications,"The special Ginkgo biloba leaf extract EGb 761 is marketed for more then two decades. During this time its therapeutic efficacy and favorable safety profile have been proven in numerous clinical trails as well as by postmarketing surveillance in accordance with German drug regulations. During recent years, however, several cases of hemorrhage have been reported to occur in coincidence with the use of Ginkgo products. Although a clear causality between Ginkgo intake and bleeding could not be established, these observations have generally been explained by the platelet-activating factor (PAF)-antagonistic action of ginkgolides, which represent characteristic constituents of Ginkgo extracts. PAF was originally characterized by inducing aggregation and secretion of serotonin and histamine from rabbit platelets. We now confirmed that induction of aggregation of human platelets by PAF requires at least 200 times higher concentration when compared to rabbit cells. Under the chosen experimental conditions, PAF-mediated aggregation of human platelets was half-maximally inhibited by ginkgolide B, A, C and J at concentrations of 2.5, 15.8, 29.8 and 43.5 microg/ml, respectively. These concentrations are generally more than 100 times higher as the peak plasma values measured after oral intake of EGb 761 at recommended doses between 120 and 240 mg. As PAF is a 'weak' platelet activator, which does not appear to be of importance for primary hemostasis, our results rise serious doubts that the PAF antagonistic effect of ginkgolides could be responsible for hemorrhage in patients taking EGb 761."

Methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), and cyclosporine (CsA) are the most widely used DMARDs in the treatment of PsA and are safe and effective in patients with active peripheral arthritis, although they do not appear to be effective on axial manifestations. No controlled study has evaluated the efficacy of these drugs on the progression of radiological damage. It has recently been demonstrated that leflunomide and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are effective in PsA and psoriasis. The symptomatic improvement has been important and sustained and side effects minimal. In particular, inhibitors of TNF appear to have excellent potential to treat PsA. These agents are able to slow joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis and they are effective on spinal symptoms in ankylosing spondylitis. Hopefully, these findings will prove true in PsA as well."

True,study postulated acute renal failure induced gentamicin transient dynamic response blood vessels could affected antioxidants prevent changes dynamic responses blood vesselsnan,19893084,gentamicin,acute renal failure,"In this study we postulated that during acute renal failure induced by gentamicin the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected, and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels. The new approach to ex vivo blood vessel experiments in which not only the end points of vessels response within the time interval is considered, but also dynamics of this response, was used in this paper. Our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals. The beneficial effects of vitamin C administration to gentamicin-treated animals are also confirmed through: lower level of blood urea and creatinine and higher level of potassium. The pressure dynamic responses of isolated blood vessels show a faster pressure change in gentamicin-treated animals (8.07 +/- 1.7 s vs. 5.64 +/- 0.18 s). Vitamin C administration induced slowdown of pressure change back to the control values. The pressure dynamic properties, quantitatively defined by comparative pressure dynamic and total pressure dynamic, confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals and beneficial effects of vitamin C administration."

The primary aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in symptom palliation of morphine-induced delirium. Twenty-one consecutive cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium underwent opioid rotation to fentanyl. Physicians recorded the symptom severity of delirium (the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, MDAS), pain, and other symptoms (categorical verbal scale from 0: none to 3: severe) and the Schedule for Team Assessment Scale (STAS) (from 0: none to 4: extreme); and performance status at the time of study enrollment and three and seven days after. Of 21 patients recruited, one patient did not complete the study. In the remaining 20 patients, morphine was substituted with transdermal fentanyl in 9 patients and parenteral fentanyl in 11 patients. Total opioid dose increased from 64 mg oral morphine equivalent/day (Day 0) to 98 mg/day (Day 7), and the median increase in total opioid dose was 42%. Treatment success, defined as an MDAS score below 10 and pain score of 2 or less, was obtained in 13 patients on Day 3 and 18 patients on Day 7. The mean MDAS score significantly decreased from 14 (Day 0) to 6.4 and 3.6 (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Pain scores significantly decreased from 2.2 (Day 0) to 1.3 and 1.1 on the categorical verbal scale (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001); from 2.6 (Day 0) to 1.6 and 1.3 on the STAS (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Symptom scores of dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting significantly decreased, and performance status significantly improved. Opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl may be effective in alleviating delirium and pain in cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium."
False,pancreatic cancer cells lack erbb display activation erbbpikakt cascade induced egfrerbb heterodimers become less critically dependent egfr signaling therefore resistant erlotinib nan,17457047,erlotinib,Pancreatic cancer,"Abnormal expression and signaling of ErbB receptors has been implicated in multiple epithelial malignancies, including pancreatic cancer. Erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has been recently approved for pancreatic cancer treatment, but there are no reliable predictors of patient response. Expression of additional ErbB receptors seems to influence tumor response to EGFR-targeted therapy. We analyzed the influence of ErbB3 expression on pancreatic cancer cell response to erlotinib treatment. Proliferation assays of five human pancreatic cancer cell lines were performed following treatment with erlotinib. Expression and phosphorylation profiles of ErbB receptors and downstream adaptor protein (Akt, ERK1/2, STAT3, mTOR) were evaluated following stimulation with EGF or neuregulin-beta. The formation of EGFR homodimers and EGFR-ErbB3 heterodimers, necessary to enable ErbB3 downstream signaling, was demonstrated by chemical cross-linking assays. The effects of RNA inhibition of ErbB3 on sensitivity to erlotinib treatment were evaluated in AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells. Erlotinib inhibited Akt phosphorylation and proliferation of all the ErbB3-expressing cell lines but did not affect mTOR activation. Cross-linking studies confirmed the presence of EGFR-ErbB3 heterodimers in pancreatic cancer cells. Only the ErbB3-deficient MIA PaCa-2 cells displayed persistent Akt activation and ongoing proliferation in spite of erlotinib treatment. siRNA-mediated inhibition of ErbB3 expression in AsPC-1 cells resulted in acquired resistance to erlotinib treatment. Pancreatic cancer cells which lack ErbB3 do not display activation of the ErbB3-PI3K-Akt cascade induced by EGFR/ErbB3 heterodimers and become less critically dependent on EGFR signaling and therefore resistant to erlotinib. Pancreatic cancer expression of ErbB3 may be useful for EGFR-targeted therapy patient selection."

False,psychic area delta thc may induce unpleasant reactions disconnected thoughts panic reactions disturbing changes perception delusions hallucinatory experiencesnan,15302527,THC,THC,"This review analyses the therapeutic usefulness of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and its potential to induce adverse reactions on humans. During the last 30 years an enormous amount of research was carried out resulting in the disclosure of the cannabinoid system in Central Nervous System, with its CB(1) and CB(2) receptors, and the agonist anandamide. Under the clinical point of view, Delta(9)-THC produces some therapeutic benefits which are beyond reasonable doubt. Thus, the effects on nausea/emesis due to cancer chemotherapy, as appetite promoter, on some painful conditions and on symptoms of multiple sclerosis are clearly demonstrated. Delta(9)-THC is not devoid of ill effects. On the cognitive domain it impairs the human capacity to discriminate time intervals and space distances, vigilance, memory and the performance for mental work. On the psychic area Delta(9)-THC may induce unpleasant reactions such as disconnected thoughts, panic reactions, disturbing changes in perception, delusions and hallucinatory experiences. However, the long term effects on the psyche and cognition are not known as there are no reports of prolonged use of Delta(9)-THC. Actually, it has been proposed by WHO that Delta(9)-THC should be rescheduled to schedule IV of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Drugs, as it does not constitute a substantial risk to public health and its abuse is rare if at all."

Fifty patients were randomized to receive either fentanyl (10 microgxkg(-1) at induction and 5 microgxkg(-1)xh(-1) infusion for maintenance) or remifentanil (3 microgxkg(-1) at induction and 1 microgxkg(-1)xmin(-1) infusion for maintenance). Patients in both groups were comparable with regard to demographics. Intraoperative volume management and inotropic therapy were similiar in both groups. Regarding heart rate, there were no significant differences between the groups at any measurement time (P > 0.05). Compared to the fentanyl group, the remifentanil group showed a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure during induction. Also, the gastric intramucosal CO(2) pressure (Pg(CO) (2)) and the P(CO) (2)-gap, defined as the difference between Pg(CO) (2) and Pa(CO) (2), were significantly increased and the gastric mucosal pH (pHi) was significantly decreased in the remifentanil group in the postinduction period (P < 0.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences in respiratory data at any time between the two groups (P > 0.05). Both fentanyl and remifentanil seemed to be effective and well tolerated in this CABG population. Episodes of hypotension and transient reduction in splanchnic perfusion were more common in patients treated with remifentanil when compared to those receiving the fentanyl opioid regimen."
True,apparent calcium chloride dissociate vocalization fighting autonomic motor phenomena mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsions caused carbachol eserinenan,6892185,carbachol,mydriasis,"The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."

Acute treatment is often delayed by difficulty in obtaining intravenous (i.v.) access. Refractory GCSE is often difficult to treat, and traditional therapy with barbiturates induces hypotension and respiratory depression and prolongs recovery. Midazolam is particularly useful for treating acute GCSE because it has an imidazole ring that is open at low pH, allowing it to be dissolved in aqueous solution for intramuscular injection, but closed at physiologic pH, increasing lipophilicity and rendering good intramuscular absorption, brain penetration, and fast onset of action. When given intramuscularly as a 0.2 mg/kg bolus, it has efficacy at least equal to that of i.v. diazepam, is well tolerated, induces little respiratory compromise, and has a shorter latency to onset of action. Therefore, it should be considered for the treatment of acute GCSE when i.v. access is problematic. For refractory GCSE, continuous i.v. midazolam infusion at 0.1-0.6 mg/kg/hr after a 0.2 mg/kg i.v. bolus is effective and has advantages over traditional therapies because it induces less hypotension and cardiorespiratory depression and can be easily titrated. Further prospective studies are needed to define the role of continuous i.v. midazolam compared to other contemporary therapies."
False,striatal alpha nicotinic acetylcholine receptors potential targets parkinson's disease therapynanused treatment,16210393,acetylcholine,Parkinson's disease,"The presence of distinct nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes in specific central nervous system (CNS) areas offers the possibility of developing targeted therapies for diseases involving the affected brain region. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by a progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal system. alpha6-containing nAChRs (designated alpha6(*)1 nAChRs) have a relatively selective localization to the nigrostriatal pathway and a limited number of other CNS regions. In addition to a unique distribution, this subtype has a distinct pharmacology and specifically interacts with alpha-conotoxinMII, a toxin key in its identification and characterization. alpha6(*) nAChRs are also regulated in a novel manner, with a decrease in their number after nicotine treatment rather than the increase observed for alpha4(*) nAChRs. Striatal alpha6(*) receptors were functional and mediate dopamine release, suggesting that they have a presynaptic localization. This is further supported by lesion studies showing that both alpha6(*) nAChR sites and their functions are dramatically decreased with dopaminergic nerve terminal loss, in contrast to only small declines in alpha4(*) and no change in alpha7(*) receptors. Although the role of nigrostriatal alpha6(*) nAChRs is only beginning to be understood, an involvement in motor behavior is emerging. This latter observation coupled with the finding that nicotine protects against nigrostriatal damage suggest that alpha6(*) nAChRs may represent unique targets for neurodegenerative disorders linked to the nigrostriatal system such as Parkinson's disease."

If this were so, patients with coronary artery disease might be especially susceptible. Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium-conserving diuretic (amiloride) and a similar period on a potassium-losing diuretic (chlorthalidone) in a randomised study. Plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol/L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy. Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight, plasma renin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens. Compared to amiloride treatment, the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats (24-hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation. The above results indicate that because potassium-losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease, even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients."

True,furthermore downregulation rat sarcoma ras upregulation extracellularsignalregulated kinase erk also observed ags cells treated curcumin western blotnan,25492214,curcumin,rat sarcoma/Ras,"Curcumin, the biologically active compound from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, could inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in gastric carcinoma. However, the underlying mechanism of curcumin on gastric carcinoma cells still needs further investigation. In this study, morphological observation indicated that curcumin inhibited the proliferation of AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner. According to the flow cytometric analysis, curcumin treatment resulted in G2/M arrest in AGS cells, accompanied with an increased expression of cyclin B1 and a decreased expression of cyclin D1. In addition, DNA ladders were observed by gel electrophoresis. Meanwhile, the activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9 were also enhanced in curcumin-treated AGS cells. Nevertheless, the increased activities could be inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OME)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), which suggested that the apoptosis was caspase-dependent. Furthermore, downregulation of rat sarcoma (Ras) and upregulation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were also observed in AGS cells treated with curcumin by Western blot. U0126, an ERK inhibitor, blocked curcumin-induced apoptosis. The results suggested that curcumin inhibited the growth of the AGS cells and induced apoptosis through the activation of Ras/ERK signaling pathway and downstream caspase cascade, and curcumin might be a potential target for the treatment of gastric carcinoma.

True,pressor bradycardia effects cirazoline abolished chronic prazosin treated shr  compared untreated shr nan,1355091,cirazoline,bradycardia,"1. Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic prazosin treatment alters the alpha 2-adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Conscious SHR (male 300-350 g) were subjected to 90 degrees head-up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.) or rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.). Orthostatic hypotension was determined by the average decrease (%) in mean arterial pressure (MAP femoral) over the 60-s tilt period. The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by prazosin (-23%(-)-26% MAP) and rauwolscine (-16%(-)-33% MAP). However, the head-up tilt induced orthostatic hypotension in the SHR treated with prazosin (-16% MAP, n = 6), but not in the SHR treated with rauwolscine (less than +2% MAP, n = 6). 3. Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with prazosin at 2 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p. for chronic alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. MAP in conscious SHR after chronic prazosin treatment was 14% lower than in the untreated SHR (n = 8). Head-up tilts in these rats did not produce orthostatic hypotension when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.). Conversely, administration of rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.) in chronic prazosin treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12-31% (n = 4), and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19-23% in these rats. 4. The pressor responses and bradycardia to the alpha 1-agonist cirazoline (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist Abbott-53693 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and noradrenaline (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic prazosin pretreatment. Both the pressor and bradycardia effects of cirazoline were abolished in chronic prazosin treated SHR (n = 4) as compared to the untreated SHR (n = 4). On the other hand, the pressor effects of Abbott-53693 were similar in both groups of SHR, but the accompanying bradycardia was greater in SHR with chronic prazosin treatment than without such treatment. Furthermore, the bradycardia that accompanied the noradrenaline-induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic prazosin treatment despite a 47-71% reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1-receptor blocked SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

True,although adr generates free radicals role free radicals development cardiac toxicity intracellular target adr induced cardiac toxicity still well understoodnan,8787689,ADR,cardiac toxicity,"Adriamycin (ADR) is a potent anticancer drug known to cause severe cardiac toxicity. Although ADR generates free radicals, the role of free radicals in the development of cardiac toxicity and the intracellular target for ADR-induced cardiac toxicity are still not well understood. We produced three transgenic mice lines expressing increased levels of human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial enzyme, as an animal model to investigate the role of ADR-mediated free radical generation in mitochondria. The human MnSOD was expressed, functionally active, and properly transported into mitochondria in the heart of transgenic mice. The levels of copper-zinc SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase did not change in the transgenic mice. Electron microscopy revealed dose-dependent ultrastructural alterations with marked mitochondrial damage in nontransgenic mice treated with ADR, but not in the transgenic littermates. Biochemical analysis indicated that the levels of serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in ADR-treated mice were significantly greater in nontransgenic than their transgenic littermates expressing a high level of human MnSOD after ADR treatment. These results support a major role for free radical generation in ADR toxicity as well as suggesting mitochondria as the critical site of cardiac injury."

He had been taking VPA for treatment of idiopathic generalized tonic-clonic convulsions since he was 56 years old. After substituting VPA with zonisamide, the serum sodium level returned to normal. We consider this episode of SIADH to be the result of a combination of factors including a weakness of the central nervous system and the long-term administration of VPA."
False,data suggest clonal abnormalities observed posttransplant best explained clinical relapse tumor ex vivo marrow purging 4-hc likely induce clonal chromosome abnormalities normal cellsnan,8453599,4-HC,clonal abnormalities,"Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) offers potentially curative therapy for patients with acute leukemia and lymphoma, yet little information exists about the chromosome abnormalities observed in ABMT recipients. Clonal abnormalities of chromosome 1 were reported by van den Akker. We report the cytogenetic results of 55 patients who underwent ABMT between November 1987 and July 1990: acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL, 22), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, eight), Hodgkin's disease (seven), lymphoma (16), other (two). ANLL patients received busulfan and cytoxan, and the others received cytoxan and total body irradiation as their preparative regimen before transplant. BM was purged ex vivo with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) at 30-100 micrograms/ml before reinfusion to kill tumor cells. Cytogenetic analysis was performed before and after transplant. Between one and four posttransplant specimens of BM were analyzed per patient (range 36-921 days). Chromosome abnormalities were observed in 14 of 55 patients after transplant. Seven had clonal abnormalities; all were in leukemic relapse, and one karyotype had complex rearrangements. Clonal abnormalities of chromosome 1 were not observed. Seven patients had nonclonal changes, and three of these have had overt clinical relapse. Our data suggest that clonal abnormalities observed posttransplant are best explained by clinical relapse of tumor and that ex vivo marrow purging with 4-HC is not likely to induce clonal chromosome abnormalities in normal cells. Long-term observation of these patients will be required to answer that question definitively, however."
True,prolonged elimination transdermal fentanyl become problematic patients develop opioidrelated adverse effects especially hypoventilation nan,14583070,fentanyl,hypoventilation,"Transdermal fentanyl is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of chronic pain caused by malignancy and non-malignant conditions when administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Compared with oral opioids, the advantages of transdermal fentanyl include a lower incidence and impact of adverse effects (constipation, nausea and vomiting, and daytime drowsiness), a higher degree of patient satisfaction, improved quality of life, improved convenience and compliance resulting from administration every 72 hours, and decreased use of rescue medication. Transdermal fentanyl is a useful analgesic for cancer patients who are unable to swallow or have gastrointestinal problems. Transdermal fentanyl forms a depot within the upper skin layers before entering the microcirculation. Therapeutic blood levels are attained 12-16 hours after patch application and decrease slowly with a half-life of 16-22 hours following removal. Patients with chronic pain should be titrated to adequate relief with short-acting oral or parenteral opioids prior to the initiation of transdermal fentanyl in order to prevent exacerbations of pain or opioid-related adverse effects. Transdermal fentanyl can then be initiated based on the 24-hour opioid requirement once adequate analgesia has been achieved. The prolonged elimination of transdermal fentanyl can become problematic if patients develop opioid-related adverse effects, especially hypoventilation. Adverse effects do not improve immediately after patch removal and may take many hours to resolve. Patients who experience opioid-related toxicity associated with respiratory depression should be treated immediately with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone and closely monitored for at least 24 hours. Because of the short half-life of naloxone, sequential doses or a continuous infusion of the opioid antagonist may be necessary. Transdermal fentanyl should be administered cautiously to patients with pre-existing conditions such as emphysema that may predispose them to the development of hypoventilation. Transdermal fentanyl is indicated only for patients who require continuous opioid administration for the treatment of chronic pain that cannot be managed with other medications. It is contraindicated in the management of acute and postoperative pain, as pain may decrease more rapidly in these circumstances than fentanyl blood levels can be adjusted, leading to the development of life-threatening hypoventilation. Cognitive and physical impairments such as confusion and abnormal co-ordination can occur with transdermal fentanyl. Therefore, patients should be instructed to refrain from driving or operating machinery immediately following the initiation of transdermal fentanyl, or after any dosage increase. Patients may resume such activities once the absence of these potential adverse effects is documented."

True,previous studies demonstrated ketamine morphine induced analgesia catalepsy ratnan,2716967,ketamine,catalepsy,"Previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and morphine induced analgesia and catalepsy in the rat. Pre-treatment with ketamine produced cross-tolerance to morphine, whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross-tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the cataleptic response; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain. The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, administered simultaneously. There was mutual potentiation between sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, but sub-effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully-effective doses of morphine. Latency to the loss of righting reflex, rigidity and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of ketamine or morphine in each combination. Naloxone inhibited the induced cataleptic effects. The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub-effective dose combinations of ketamine and morphine were similar. Rats, tolerant to ketamine-dominant combinations, were cross-tolerant to both drugs, while those tolerant to morphine-dominant combinations were cross-tolerant to morphine but showed either no cross-tolerance or an augmented response to ketamine. While the mutual potentiation, antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced catalepsy, differences in latency, rigidity and behavior, asymmetry of cross-tolerance and a widely-different ID50 for naloxone would argue against an action at a single opioid site."
False,conclude single day course tobramycin treatment patients cystic fibrosis preexisiting auditory deficit measurable effect hearing apparent either threetimesdaily treatmentnan,16801404,tobramycin,cystic fibrosis,"We undertook assessment of hearing in patients with cystic fibrosis who were taking part in a large randomized controlled trial of once- versus three-times-daily tobramycin for pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (the TOPIC study). All patients were eligible to have standard pure tone audiometry performed across the frequency range of 0.25 to 8 kHz. High-frequency pure tone audiometry over 10 to 16 kHz was also performed with a subset of patients. Audiometry was undertaken at the start of tobramycin treatment, at the end of a 14-day course of treatment, and at follow-up 6 to 8 weeks later. We enrolled 244 patients, of whom 219 (125 children and 94 adults) completed treatment. Nineteen patients were excluded from analysis due to abnormal baseline audiometry. Complete pre- and posttreatment standard audiological data were obtained for 168/219 patients. We found no significant differences in hearing thresholds when they were assessed at the baseline, at the end of treatment, and at follow-up 6 to 8 weeks later were compared. In addition, no significant differences in hearing thresholds were detected between treatment regimens. Similar results were obtained for the subset of 63/168 patients who underwent high-frequency audiometry. We conclude that for a single 14-day course of tobramycin treatment in patients with cystic fibrosis with no preexisiting auditory deficit, no measurable effect on hearing was apparent with either once- or three-times-daily treatment. Estimation of the cumulative cochleotoxic risk in cystic fibrosis patients due to repeated aminoglycoside therapy, as evidenced by the patients excluded from this study due to hearing loss, also requires further characterization."
True,however three case control studies one north carolina northern maryland west berlin germany showed habitual use acetaminophen also associated chronic renal failure esrd relative risk range habitual use acetaminophen causes chronic renal failure,8669433,acetaminophen,chronic renal failure/ESRD,"Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of phenacetin is associated with the development of chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19. As a result of these and other studies, phenacetin has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries. However, three case control studies, one each in North Carolina, northern Maryland, and West Berlin, Germany, showed that habitual use of acetaminophen is also associated with chronic renal failure and ESRD, with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4. These studies suggest that both phenacetin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of ESRD, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former. This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in nephrotoxic potential of the drugs themselves. A lower relative risk would be expected for acetaminophen if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone. Thus, acetaminophen has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics, whereas phenacetin was available only in combinations. The possibility that habitual use of acetaminophen alone increases the risk of ESRD has not been clearly demonstrated, but cannot be dismissed."

The use of amiodarone has, however, been limited due to its serious side-effects. A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to amiodarone treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is given. It is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic injury due to amiodarone treatment, including steatosis, alterations resembling alcoholic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis of the liver. Patients receiving amiodarone should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels. Therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of cholestatic injury or hepatomegaly."

Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is increasingly used as an alternative to FEIBA; however, the thrombotic safety profile of rFVIIa remains incompletely characterized. To determine the incidence rates of thrombotic adverse events (AEs) after infusion of rFVIIa and FEIBA. Data from the MedWatch pharmacovigilance program of the US Food and Drug Administration, as supplemented by published case reports, were used in conjunction with estimated numbers of infusions available from manufacturers to assess comparative incidence of thrombotic AEs in patients receiving rFVIIa or FEIBA in the period from April 1999 through June 2002. Reported thrombotic AEs were rare, with incidence rates of 24.6 per 10(5) infusions (CI, 19.1-31.2 per 10(5) infusions) for rFVIIa and 8.24 per 10(5) infusions (CI, 4.71-13.4 per 10(5) infusions) for FEIBA. Thrombotic AEs were significantly more frequent in rFVIIa than FEIBA recipients (incidence rate ratio, 2.98; CI, 1.71-5.52). The most commonly documented single type of thrombotic AE after rFVIIa infusion was cerebrovascular thrombosis, while myocardial infarction was the most frequent type in patients receiving FEIBA. Contrasting AE reporting patterns between rFVIIa and FEIBA may have contributed to the observed difference in thrombotic event incidence. Nevertheless, this comprehensive pharmacovigilance assessment does not support superior thrombotic safety of rFVIIa and suggests that thrombotic AE risk may be higher in rFVIIa than FEIBA recipients."
True,moreover alcohol abuse produce cardiac arrhythmias hypertension cardiomyopathy stroke even sudden deathnan,9751945,alcohol,cardiac arrhythmias,"The ingestion of one or two alcoholic drinks can affect heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, myocardial contractility, and regional blood flow. These actions generally are not clinically important. In the presence of cardiovascular disease, however, even such small quantities of alcohol might result in transient unfavorable hemodynamic changes. Moreover, alcohol abuse can produce cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, stroke, and even sudden death. In contrast, moderate alcohol use produces changes that have an overall favorable effect on atherosclerotic-related vascular diseases. Because cardiovascular disease due to atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in Western society, this desirable effect of alcohol use outweighs its detrimental actions, resulting in favorable findings in population studies. Nevertheless, the body of evidence argues against encouraging alcohol use for its cardiovascular effects."

We report on the management of six patients who developed diabetes mellitus following treatment with olanzapine, five of whom had independent risk factors for diabetes. Olanzapine was changed to quetiapine in all patients with improvement in glycaemic control in two patients. In view of the uncertainty of the size and mechanism of the link between olanzapine and diabetes, we discuss issues surrounding routine clinical management and monitoring of patients on antipsychotics and the clinical implications."
True,microtubule inhibitor mtibased chemotherapies used treatment breast cancerincluding vinca alkaloids taxanes epothilonesare known associated peripheral neuropathy nan,18567992,taxanes,peripheral neuropathy,"Microtubule inhibitor (MTI)-based chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer--including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones--are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone."

Patients had tumours that failed or progressed after first-line platinum-containing regimens for advanced or metastatic disease, or had progressive disease after platinum-containing chemotherapy given with adjuvant or neoadjuvant intent. Response and adverse events were assessed according to WHO criteria and NCI-CTC (version 2), respectively. Out of 51 patients treated with 320 mg m(-2) of vinflunine, nine patients responded to the therapy yielding an overall response rate of 18% (95% CI: 8.4-30.9%), and 67% (95%CI: 52.1-79.3%) achieved disease control (PR+SD). Of note, responses were seen in patients with relatively poor prognostic factors such as a short (<12 months) interval from prior platinum therapy (19%, including an 11% response rate in those progressing <3 months after platinum treatment), prior treatment for metastatic disease (24%), prior treatment with vinca alkaloids (14%) and visceral involvement (20%). The median duration of response was 9.1 months (95% CI: 4.2-15.0) and the median PFS was 3.0 months (95% CI: 2.4-3.8). The median OS was 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.8-7.6). The main haematological toxicity was grade 3-4 neutropenia, observed in 67% of patients (42% of cycles). Febrile neutropenia was observed in five patients (10%) and among them two were fatal. Constipation was frequently observed (but was manageable and noncumulative) and was grade 3-4 in only 8% of patients. The incidence of grade 3 nausea and vomiting was very low (4 and 6% of patients, respectively). Neither grade 3-4 sensory neuropathy nor severe venous irritation was observed. Moreover, and of importance in this particular study population, no grade 3-4 renal function impairment was observed. Vinflunine is an active agent for the treatment of platinum-pretreated bladder cancer, and these results warrant further investigation in phase III trials, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents as treatment of advanced/metastatic TCC of the bladder."

Acetaminophen-poisoned cats develop methemoglobinemia and sometimes hepatic failure. To determine the benefit of using methylene blue, a treatment for methemoglobinemia, along with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the recommended treatment for acetaminophen-poisoned cats, groups of 3 male and 3 female cats each were given methylene blue NAC, or both after administration of acetaminophen (120 mg/kg of body weight, PO). Male cats seemed more susceptible than female cats to acetaminophen toxicosis, because 3 males died of hepatic failure (2 cats given acetaminophen/methylene blue and 1 given acetaminophen/NAC/methylene blue). Although NAC alone seemed to elicit the best overall response, methylene blue, alone or in combination with NAC, may be useful in female cats."
True,inhaled silicate dusts may cause lung disease surface coordination iron subsequent oxidant generation via fenton reactionnan,1977006,iron,lung disease,"Inhaled silicate dusts may cause lung disease through their surface coordination of iron with subsequent oxidant generation via the Fenton reaction. Pneumoconiosis, irritant bronchitis, focal emphysema, and carcinoma may be produced by oxidants either directly through lipid peroxidation and protein inactivation, or indirectly by oxidant-mediated release of cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor. The increased incidence of tuberculosis observed among silicate workers could be explained by accumulation of iron complexed by dust particles in the lung and made available to dormant mycobacteria as a virulence factor."

The GRP analogues had no effect on basal cytosolic Ca2+ but inhibited the increase caused by 10 nM BN. BW462U89 reversibly blocked the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ caused by BN. The GRP analogues (1 microM) inhibited NCI-H345 colony formation in the absence or presence of 10 nM BN. Also, BW2258U89 (0.4 mg/kg, s.c. daily) inhibited xenograft growth in nude mice. These data indicate that BW2258U89 inhibits SCLC growth in vitro and in vivo."

These patients are at risk for coronary events, and nitroglycerin may be required to treat acute symptoms of myocardial ischemia. Nitroglycerin rapidly loses potency when stored improperly, compromising effectiveness. Previous studies indicate that patients frequently fail to store nitroglycerin properly. Accordingly, pharmacists routinely advise patients to renew nitroglycerin tablets every 6 months. The purpose of this study was to determine frequency of prescription of nitroglycerin and the relationship to potency in patients participating in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs."

False,standard culturebased testing susceptibility mycobacterium tuberculosis pyrazinamide difficult performnan,21768515,pyrazinamide,tuberculosis,"Standard culture-based testing of the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to pyrazinamide is difficult to perform. This systematic review with meta-analyses evaluated the roles of molecular assays targeting pncA and of pyrazinamidase assays. PubMed and Embase were searched for relevant publications in English. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated in bivariate random-effects models. Of 128 articles identified, 73 sets of data involving culture isolates were initially included in meta-analyses. Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were 87% and 93% for PCR-DNA sequencing (n = 29), 75% and 95% for PCR-single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) (n = 5), 96% and 97% for a mixture of other molecular assays (n = 6), and 89% and 97% for pyrazinamidase assays using the Wayne method (n = 33). The median prevalence (range) of pyrazinamide resistance was 51% (31% to 89%) in multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates and 5% (0% to 9%) in non-multidrug-resistant isolates. Excluding studies with possibly considerable false resistance in the reference assay gave the following estimates of sensitivity and specificity, respectively: 92% and 93% for PCR-DNA sequencing (n = 20), 98% and 96% for other molecular assays (n = 5), and 91% and 97% for the Wayne assay (n = 27). The Wayne assay had significant funnel plot asymmetry, so the test performance might have been overestimated. Considering the prevalence of pyrazinamide resistance in different clinical settings, PCR-DNA sequencing, and possibly other molecular assays targeting pncA, can detect pyrazinamide resistance in multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates, with predictive values largely exceeding 90%, and rule out pyrazinamide resistance in non-multidrug-resistant isolates, with predictive values exceeding 99%. Molecular assays are probably the way forward for detecting pyrazinamide resistance."
False,findings indicate causes profound suppression adrenal steroid production addition suppresses ovarian secretion androgens postmenopausal breast cancer patientsnan,9816328,androgens,breast cancer,"Twelve postmenopausal women suffering from advanced breast cancer had plasma estrogens, androgens, cortisol, and gonadotropins determined before therapy and during treatment with megestrol acetate (MA) in oral doses escalated from 40 to 160 mg. The plasma clearance and production rate of estrone and estrone sulfate were determined before treatment and after 4 weeks of therapy with 160 mg MA. Treatment with MA suppressed plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, and cortisol in a dose-dependent manner to <10% of pretreatment values. Plasma testosterone, estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate were suppressed to 18-29% of pretreatment values, whereas the gonadotropins were suppressed to 35-52%. The plasma clearance rates of estrone and estrone sulfate were increased by a mean value of 23.7% (P < 0.01) and 23.5% (P < 0.025), whereas the production rates were reduced by 76.7% (P < 0.0005) and 76.1% (P < 0.0005), respectively. Our findings indicate that MA causes profound suppression of adrenal steroid production but in addition suppresses ovarian secretion of androgens in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. The reduction in plasma estrogens is comparable to values obtained with commonly used aromatase inhibitors and may be responsible for its antitumor effects in breast cancer."

False,circulating levels mcp silr il il predict anemia response pomalidomide therapy myelofibrosis nan,21442636,pomalidomide,myelofibrosis,"Cytokine-phenotype associations have recently been described in primary myelofibrosis and increased levels of IL-8, sIL-2R, IL-12, and IL-15 were found to be independently predictive of inferior survival. Pomalidomide therapy is effective for alleviating anemia in myelofibrosis; we examined the relationship between plasma cytokine/chemokine levels and response to treatment with pomalidomide. The study population included 32 Mayo Clinic patients (median age 66 years) who participated in two consecutive clinical trials of pomalidomide therapy for myelofibrosis-associated anemia. Ten (31%) patients achieved anemia response per International Working Group criteria. Anemia response was seen only in the presence of JAK2V617F (P = 0.04) and, in addition, predicted by lower circulating levels of MCP-1 (P = 0.003), IL-2R (P = 0.008), IL-15 (0.01), and IL-8 (P = 0.02). Marked splenomegaly and increased serum LDH level were associated with poor response (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively) and with each other (P = 0.02), but not with JAK2V617F. The aforementioned cytokines were not significantly associated with JAK2V617F but increased levels of sIL-2R (P = 0.01), IL-15 (P = 0.06), and MCP-1 (P = 0.07) clustered with marked splenomegaly. Current data suggest that, in the context of pomalidomide treatment, response is more likely in the presence of JAK2V617F and further predicted by the absence of marked splenomegaly or increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines."

False,however according california regulations lithium batteries tested classified hazardous due excessive levels cobalt average mgkg  limit copper average mgkg  limit nickel average mgkg  limit nan,23638841,lithium,California regulations,"Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-polymer (Li-poly) batteries have recently become dominant in consumer electronic products because of advantages associated with energy density and product longevity. However, the small size of these batteries, the high rate of disposal of consumer products in which they are used, and the lack of uniform regulatory policy on their disposal means that lithium batteries may contribute substantially to environmental pollution and adverse human health impacts due to potentially toxic materials. In this research, we used standardized leaching tests, life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and hazard assessment models to evaluate hazardous waste classification, resource depletion potential, and toxicity potentials of lithium batteries used in cellphones. Our results demonstrate that according to U.S. federal regulations, defunct Li-ion batteries are classified hazardous due to their lead (Pb) content (average 6.29 mg/L; σ = 11.1; limit 5). However, according to California regulations, all lithium batteries tested are classified hazardous due to excessive levels of cobalt (average 163,544 mg/kg; σ = 62,897; limit 8000), copper (average 98,694 mg/kg; σ = 28,734; limit 2500), and nickel (average 9525 mg/kg; σ = 11,438; limit 2000). In some of the Li-ion batteries, the leached concentrations of chromium, lead, and thallium exceeded the California regulation limits. The environmental impact associated with resource depletion and human toxicity is mainly associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver, whereas the ecotoxicity potential is primarily associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver. However, the relative contribution of aluminum and lithium to human toxicity and ecotoxicity could not be estimated due to insufficient toxicity data in the models. These findings support the need for stronger government policy at the local, national, and international levels to encourage recovery, recycling, and reuse of lithium battery materials."
False,cells bcrmediated apoptosis affected nystatin treatment whereas increased beta mcd pretreated cellsnan,14565868,nystatin,MCD,"We examined the role of BCR cell membrane redistribution in anti-IgM-induced apoptosis in three human B cell lines, RA#1, 2G6, and MC116, that differ in their relative levels of sIgM expression. The apoptotic response was found to be dependent on the nature of the anti-IgM and the cell line. In the cell lines, RA#1 and MC116, sIgM aggregated into patches that were insensitive to the disruption of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains by nystatin or beta-MCD. The B cell line 2G6 was able to reorganize sIgM into a tight coalescent cap upon anti-IgM treatment. However, in this case, the lipid raft inhibitors nystatin and beta-MCD disrupted the patching. In 2G6 cells, BCR-mediated apoptosis was not affected by nystatin treatment, whereas it increased in beta-MCD pretreated cells. Thus, no evident correlation was found between apoptosis and BCR cell membrane redistribution or lipid raft formation in either of the three cell lines. The data indicate that the apoptotic signal transduction pathway is independent of BCR translocation into lipid rafts and/or aggregation."

In two large (both n = 480), well designed, 3-week trials in adult patients with bipolar I disorder, asenapine monotherapy was significantly more effective than placebo at improving mania symptoms, as assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale total score (YMRS; primary endpoint), with significant differences between the asenapine and placebo groups occurring after 2 days of treatment. In both trials, Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) scale mania severity scores exceeded those of placebo. In one trial, response and remission rates exceeded those of placebo. In a 9-week extension study that recruited completers from the monotherapy trials, there were no significant differences between asenapine and olanzapine groups in terms in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, CGI-BP mania severity scores, YMRS response rates or YMRS remission rates during the extension phase. In the extension study, the efficacy of asenapine monotherapy appeared to be maintained over 40 weeks (total treatment duration of 52 weeks). In a 12-week trial of asenapine as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate, asenapine was more effective than placebo in improving manic symptoms, based on the difference between groups in the YMRS total score at week 3 (primary endpoint). Most adverse events associated with asenapine were of mild to moderate severity, with <7% of asenapine recipients experiencing serious adverse events (vs 7% with placebo). In a pooled analysis of the monotherapy trials, the most common adverse events (occurring in ≥ 5% of patients and at twice the incidence of placebo) reported during acute phase asenapine monotherapy for bipolar mania were somnolence, dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS, other than akathisia) and increased bodyweight, which were similar in nature to those occurring during longer-term monotherapy with asenapine. EPS did not worsen in severity during longer-term asenapine monotherapy. Asenapine had minimal effects on plasma glucose, lipid and prolactin levels over both short- and longer-term treatment periods, and had little pro-arrhythmogenic potential. Further active comparator trials and longer-term tolerability and safety data are required. In the meantime, asenapine is a further option for the management of manic and/or mixed symptoms in patients with bipolar I disorder and may be of particular value for patients who are at high risk for metabolic abnormalities."

The long term effectiveness and adverse effects of this drug combination for the treatment of HIV were evaluated in an ambispective study at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Nonthaburi Province, Thailand from March 2002 to January 2006. A total of 152 adult treatment naive HIV patients who had received at least 12 months of GPO-VIR were enrolled. The median (IQR) CD4 cell count increased from 23 (8-94) cells/microl at baseline to 126 (38-180), 136 (98-189), 199 (141-255) and 334 (243-414) cells/microl at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months (p < 0.001), respectively. The median (IQR) percentage of body weights increased from baseline by 3.0% (0.3-6.3), 6.2% (2.2-9.3), 7.3% (3.9-10.9) and 8.1% (3.4-11.9) at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively and then remained at a plateau until the end of the 3-year study. The occurrence of new opportunistic infections decreased significantly (p < 0.001) with GPO-VIR treatment. Drug resistance occurred in 5 cases (3.3%) with a median (IQR) time of 18.0 (16.5-32.5) months to occurrence. Adverse effects included hypercholesterolemia (43.2%), lipodystrophy (35.5%), hypertriglyceridemia (25%), hypertension (13.1%), peripheral neuropathy (11.9%), hyperlactatemia (2.6%) and lactic acidosis (1.3%). Thirty-six patients (27%) switched from GPO-VIR to other anti-retroviral drugs regimens due to lipodystrophy. This study showed GPO-VIR had clinical and immunological benefits, but one-third of patients had adverse effects."
False,hand mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsions evoked carbachol eserine significantly changed calcium chloride nan,6892185,calcium chloride,mydriasis,"The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."

Because drinking patterns can include periods of alcohol consumption followed by abstinence, binge drinking may enhance the possibility of brain damage. Chronic administration of ethanol leads to upregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and calcium receptors and increased release of glucocorticoids. NMDA-mediated mechanisms and glucocorticoid actions on the hippocampus are associated with brain damage. Thus, ethanol withdrawal may make the brain more vulnerable to damage from these mechanisms, especially with binge drinking. Therapeutic adjuncts for treating ethanol withdrawal, including NMDA, calcium, and glucocorticoid antagonists, may eventually prove useful in preventing further brain damage in alcoholism."
False,endomorphin muopioid receptor agonists produced concentrationdependent naloxone sensitive inhibition cholinergic contractile responses guineapig trachea microm    respectivelynan,10422636,naloxone,trachea,"Endomorphin-1 and -2 (mu-opioid receptor agonists) produced a concentration-dependent and naloxone-sensitive inhibition of cholinergic contractile responses in guinea-pig trachea (at 10 microM, 46.1 +/- 8.0% and 33.8 +/- 8.6%, respectively). Endomorphin-1 and -2 also inhibited electrically-evoked acetylcholine release from cholinergic nerves innervating guinea-pig (at 0.1 microM, 41.8 +/- 10.9%; at 1 microM 60.1 +/- 6.3%, respectively) and human trachea (at 10 microM, 76.2 +/- 18.1%, and 77.7 +/- 14.3%, respectively). Naloxone prevented the inhibition by endomorphin-1 and -2 in both guinea-pig and human trachea, suggesting that these peptides can inhibit cholinergic, parasympathetic neurotransmission to the airways via the activation of classical opioid receptors."

True,animal experiments highdose exposure cd induced severe testicular interstitial hemorrhage edema increased incidence fetal death placental necrosisnan,16788562,Cd,edema,"Cadmium (Cd) is an industrial and environmental pollutant that exerts adverse effects on a number of organs in humans and animals. Reproductive organs, such as the testis and placenta, are sensitive to the toxic effects of Cd. In animal experiments, high-dose exposure to Cd induced severe testicular interstitial hemorrhage with edema, and increased incidence of fetal death and placental necrosis. Low-dose exposure to Cd affects steroid synthesis in male and female reproductive organs. In 1998, the Ministry of Environment in Japan listed Cd in the strategy plan SPEED98 as one of the chemicals suspected of having possible endocrine disrupting activity. Recently, it has been shown that Cd has potent estrogen- and androgen-like activities in vivo and in vitro, by directly binding to estrogen and androgen receptors. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of Cd as an endocrine disruptor remain to be elucidated. In this review, we will discuss evidence thus far presented concerning the effects of Cd on the endocrine system."
True,although androgens effect prostatic cells believed dihydrotestosterone dht active metabolite primarily utilized prostatic cancer cells growth divisionnan,8358057,dihydrotestosterone/DHT,prostatic cancer,"Prostate carcinomas are heterogeneous tumors composed of hormone sensitive and hormone insensitive cells. Although all androgens have an effect on prostatic cells, it is believed that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the active metabolite primarily utilized by prostatic cancer cells for growth and division. Hormonal therapies are therefore designed to lower tissue levels of DHT or prevent its binding to receptors on prostatic cancer cells. The Veterans Administration Cooperative studies in the 1960s and 1970s laid the groundwork for the use and timing of hormonal therapy. Until recently orchiectomy and estrogens were the two main alternatives, but new compounds such as luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogs and antiandrogens have shown to be as effective and less toxic than estrogens. Today, important controversies concerning the selection of the best primary treatment and the timing of initiating the hormonal therapy still exist. Second line hormonal strategies are used, but they still have to prove their impact on overall survival."

MTH-68/H, a live attenuated oncolytic viral strain of the Newcastle disease virus, is one of the viruses used in the treatment of different malignancies. Here we report on the administration of MTH-68/H to patients with glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and most aggressive neuroectodermal neoplasm with a poor prognosis, averaging six months to a year. Four cases of advanced high-grade glioma were treated with MTH-68/H after the conventional modalities of anti-neoplastic therapies had failed. This treatment resulted in survival rates of 5-9 years, with each patient still living today. Against all odds, each patient resumed a lifestyle that resembles their previous daily routines and enjoys a good quality of life, Each of these patients has regularly received MTH-68/H as their sole form of onco-therapy for a number of years now without interruption."
True,environmental impact associated resource depletion human toxicity mainly associated cobalt copper nickel thallium silver whereas ecotoxicity potential primarily associated cobalt copper nickel thallium silver nan,23638841,silver,toxicity,"Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-polymer (Li-poly) batteries have recently become dominant in consumer electronic products because of advantages associated with energy density and product longevity. However, the small size of these batteries, the high rate of disposal of consumer products in which they are used, and the lack of uniform regulatory policy on their disposal means that lithium batteries may contribute substantially to environmental pollution and adverse human health impacts due to potentially toxic materials. In this research, we used standardized leaching tests, life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and hazard assessment models to evaluate hazardous waste classification, resource depletion potential, and toxicity potentials of lithium batteries used in cellphones. Our results demonstrate that according to U.S. federal regulations, defunct Li-ion batteries are classified hazardous due to their lead (Pb) content (average 6.29 mg/L; σ = 11.1; limit 5). However, according to California regulations, all lithium batteries tested are classified hazardous due to excessive levels of cobalt (average 163,544 mg/kg; σ = 62,897; limit 8000), copper (average 98,694 mg/kg; σ = 28,734; limit 2500), and nickel (average 9525 mg/kg; σ = 11,438; limit 2000). In some of the Li-ion batteries, the leached concentrations of chromium, lead, and thallium exceeded the California regulation limits. The environmental impact associated with resource depletion and human toxicity is mainly associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver, whereas the ecotoxicity potential is primarily associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver. However, the relative contribution of aluminum and lithium to human toxicity and ecotoxicity could not be estimated due to insufficient toxicity data in the models. These findings support the need for stronger government policy at the local, national, and international levels to encourage recovery, recycling, and reuse of lithium battery materials."

We performed an epi-analysis of two randomized controlled trials. The participants were 313 women aged 18-42 years with PCOS who had singleton pregnancies. They were randomized to metformin or placebo treatment from first trimester until delivery. We analysed the prevalence of late miscarriage/preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes according to both the intention-to-treat principle and per protocol analysis. The metformin-treated patients had less late miscarriage/preterm delivery; five (3%) vs. 18 (11%) in the placebo group (p < 0.01). There was no difference in the prevalence of gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia between the metformin and the placebo group. In this epi-analysis, metformin treatment during pregnancy seems to reduce early delivery in women with PCOS. We believe that further randomized studies should be performed before firm conclusions can be drawn."

Clinical success (cure + improvement) rates were similar for both groups at the end of treatment (day 10; azithromycin, 124 of 133 [93%]; pivampicillin, 79 of 92 [86%]) and at follow-up (day 52; 98 of 126 [78%] versus 66 of 81 [81%]). The treatments produced similar levels of pathogen eradication at the end of treatment (49 of 54 [91%] versus 32 of 37 [86%]). Azithromycin-treated patients had significantly reduced chest discomfort at the end of treatment, and a trend towards improved lung function. The two groups were similar with respect to improvements in other clinical symptoms and patient well-being, and to the incidences of adverse events and treatment discontinuations. This oral azithromycin regime is an effective treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, similar in efficacy to the longer pivampicillin regime and may offer superior patient compliance."

True,sensitization cells cisplatin cytotoxicity induced pakt inhibition mediated upregulation puma whereas induced perk inhibition occurred bcl downregulationnan,23783141,cisplatin,cytotoxicity,"Cisplatin is widely used for the treatment of solid tumours including small cell lung cancers, but its success is often compromised by relapse and resistance to further treatment. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt are two major cell survival pathways that are upregulated and activated in lung cancer tissues. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and Akt (p-Akt) can be further stimulated by chemotherapeutics in cancer cells. Although individually targeting the ERK1/2 or Akt pathway has been reported to sensitize cancer cells to therapy, the effect of concurrently blocking these two pathways on the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to cisplatin has not been investigated. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways contribute to cisplatin resistance in human small cell lung cancer A549 cells. The results showed that cisplatin activates p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt in A549 cells. Blockade of either of these pathways with chemical inhibitors moderately sensitized A549 cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and reduced cell viability. Strikingly, concurrent inhibition of p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt significantly potentiated cisplatin cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. The sensitization of A549 cells to cisplatin cytotoxicity induced by p-Akt inhibition was mediated by the upregulation of PUMA, whereas that induced by p-ERK1/2 inhibition occurred by Bcl-2 downregulation. These data indicate that the cooperative effects of p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt on attenuating cisplatin cytotoxicity are mediated by PUMA and Bcl-2 regulation, and concurrently blocking these pathways may be an effective strategy for improving the efficacy of cisplatin as anticancer treatment."
True,estimation cumulative cochleotoxic risk cystic fibrosis patients due repeated aminoglycoside therapy evidenced patients excluded study due hearing loss also requires characterizationnan,16801404,aminoglycoside,cystic fibrosis,"We undertook assessment of hearing in patients with cystic fibrosis who were taking part in a large randomized controlled trial of once- versus three-times-daily tobramycin for pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (the TOPIC study). All patients were eligible to have standard pure tone audiometry performed across the frequency range of 0.25 to 8 kHz. High-frequency pure tone audiometry over 10 to 16 kHz was also performed with a subset of patients. Audiometry was undertaken at the start of tobramycin treatment, at the end of a 14-day course of treatment, and at follow-up 6 to 8 weeks later. We enrolled 244 patients, of whom 219 (125 children and 94 adults) completed treatment. Nineteen patients were excluded from analysis due to abnormal baseline audiometry. Complete pre- and posttreatment standard audiological data were obtained for 168/219 patients. We found no significant differences in hearing thresholds when they were assessed at the baseline, at the end of treatment, and at follow-up 6 to 8 weeks later were compared. In addition, no significant differences in hearing thresholds were detected between treatment regimens. Similar results were obtained for the subset of 63/168 patients who underwent high-frequency audiometry. We conclude that for a single 14-day course of tobramycin treatment in patients with cystic fibrosis with no preexisiting auditory deficit, no measurable effect on hearing was apparent with either once- or three-times-daily treatment. Estimation of the cumulative cochleotoxic risk in cystic fibrosis patients due to repeated aminoglycoside therapy, as evidenced by the patients excluded from this study due to hearing loss, also requires further characterization."

At a dose of 4 mg the drug significantly reduced the fall in FEV1 compared with placebo but not with respect to basal values. In 9 athletes, 4 mg nedocromil sodium produced a good protective effect and reduced the mean fall in FEV1 to 4% with respect to baseline values, while in the remaining 4 subjects, the protective effect was not satisfactory. In these 4 ""non responders"" 6 mg nedocromil was effective, and in 2 cases induced prolonged bronchodilatation. In conclusion, the effect of nedocromil sodium in the prevention of EIB may be dose-dependent in relation to the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity or to interference of other factors."

Halothane hepatitis appears to involve an aberrant immune response. An antibody response to a protein-bound biotransformation product (trifluoroacetyl adduct) has been detected on halothane hepatitis patients. This study was performed to determine cross-reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by halothane. The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by halothane-induced antibodies following enflurane and isoflurane, and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models. Enflurane administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver. In the same liver, biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20-fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats. This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which enflurane and/or isoflurane could produce a hypersensitivity condition similar to that of halothane hepatitis either alone or subsequent to halothane administration. The guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens."

True,results demonstrate 12(s)-hete shete activates erk fak signalling pathways thereby upregulates adhesion metastatic potential melanoma cellsnan,23664097,12(S)-HETE,melanoma,"12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) is a non-haeme iron-containing dioxygenase that forms 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) or 15(S)-HETE. Several biological mediators including cytokines, growth factors and lipid metabolites released during tumour cell-endothelial cell adhesion are associated with malignant tumour progression. Here we found that HETEs released from the host organ played a critical role in tumour metastasis. Intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma cells caused lung nodule formation, which was markedly attenuated in 12/15-LOX null mice. Co-injection of melanoma cells with 12(S)-HETE increased the lung homing activity of B16F10 melanoma cells. In vitro studies showed that 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent increase of adhesion of B16F10 cells on collagen or fibronectin. The melanoma cell adhesion was then evaluated in pulmonary primary cell culture isolated from wild-type (WT) and 12/15-LOX knockout (KO) mice. It was found that the adhesion of melanoma cells on the epithelial cells isolated from 12/15-LOX null mice was reduced in comparison with those isolated from WT mice. Treatment of 12(S)-HETE increased the pFAK in melanoma cells adhering on collagen-coated slide. The enhancement of adherence elicited by 12(S)-HETE in B16F10 cells could be antagonised by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor 14 (FAK inhibitor) or PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor). 12(S)-HETE increased the phosphorylation of FAK and ERK in adhering melanoma cells. The FAK phosphorylation induced by 12(S)-HETE was further inhibited by PD98059, indicating that FAK is the downstream target of ERK. The adhesion and lung metastasis of human melanoma cells of C32 in NOD/SCID mice were also potentiated by co-treatment with 12(S)-HETE. These results demonstrate that 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE activates ERK and FAK signalling pathways, thereby upregulates the adhesion and metastatic potential of melanoma cells. The endogenous release of 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE in the host organ may affect the metastatic potential of melanoma. "

Treatment decisions for relapse or refractory multiple myeloma should be based on a clinical decision path taking response and adverse events to previous therapy, myeloma specific complications and organ dysfunctions, overall clinical condition, age, cytogenetic information and prognostic factors into account. Bortezomib, thalidomide and lenalidomide have improved the therapeutic armentarium for patients with refractory or relapsed disease and are often used in combination with dexamethasone or chemotherapeutic agents. Combination therapies of novel agents in drug combination regimen are currently under investigation as well. For patients with a disease free survival of 12 month or longer after initial single or tandem high dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) repeat of high dose therapy with melphalan and ASCT should be considered in case of relapse. Radiotherapy and osteoplastic procedures can be used as adjunct to systemic therapy to treat local complications in particular vertebral pain caused by osteolytic bone disease. Cytogenetic tests, molecular techniques as gene expression profiling and other diagnostic will lead to a more individualized therapy. The integration of novel compounds into established regimen will be a major challenge for future clinical studies."

Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."

True,little known cardiovascular effects memantine reports bradycardia reduced cardiovascular survival associated usenan,24777654,memantine,bradycardia,"Drugs that are used to treat Alzheimer's disease include the acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors (ACHIs) donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine and the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. Adverse cardiovascular events with these drugs are very uncommon. However, there is evidence that ACHI therapy is associated with a small but significant increase in the risk of syncope and bradycardia. There are also a few reports that these drugs may occasionally be associated with QT prolongation and torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia. Adverse cardiovascular effects of ACHIs including syncope and bradycardia are less common than their adverse gastrointestinal effects, but they remain important considerations in susceptible individuals. In contrast, animal studies and some observational studies suggest that ACHIs may reduce myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality and have favourable effects on hemodynamics and survival in heart failure. Further research is required to confirm these potential beneficial effects. Little is known about the cardiovascular effects of memantine but there have been reports of bradycardia and reduced cardiovascular survival associated with its use. "

In the ANRS-1201/1202 Ditrame study, conducted in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, a short-course regimen of zidovudine was associated with sdNVP for PMTCT. In this study, we estimate the frequency of NVP resistance and its relationship with NVP concentration in mothers. Genotypic resistance analysis was performed on mothers' plasma samples at week 4 postpartum (PP) and on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) when an NVP resistance mutation was detected. The same tests were performed for the infected children at week 4, month 3, and month 12. Mothers' NVP plasma concentrations were measured at 48 h PP. Twenty-one (33%) of the 63 women selected had NVP-resistant (NVP-R) virus at week 4 PP. The median plasma NVP concentration was 598 ng/ml for the mothers without NVP-R virus compared to 851 ng/ml for the mothers harboring NVP-R virus (P = 0.014). NVP-R mutations were detected in the HIV DNA of 15/20 women. Plasma NVP-R mutations were detectable in 6 of 26 infected children at week 4. All 6 children had detectable NVP-R mutations in HIV DNA of PBMC. Blood samples taken at month 3 (1 child) and month 12 (1 child) revealed the persistence of NVP-R mutations in plasma and cells. Emergence of NVP-R virus in mothers is strongly correlated with a high level of plasma NVP concentration, owing to a prolonged postpartum period of viral replication under NVP selective pressure. The follow-up of the cohort demonstrates the prolonged archive of resistant virus."

AF with a rapid ventricular rate may cause a tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy. Immediate direct-current cardioversion should be performed in patients with AF and acute myocardial infarction, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, hypotension, severe heart failure, or syncope. Intravenous beta blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem may be given to immediately slow a very rapid ventricular rate in AF. An oral beta blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem should be used in persons with AF if a fast ventricular rate occurs at rest or during exercise despite digoxin. Amiodarone may be used in selected patients with symptomatic life-threatening AF refractory to other drugs. Digoxin should not be used to treat patients with paroxysmal AF. Nonpharmacologic therapies should be used in patients with symptomatic AF in whom a rapid ventricular rate cannot be slowed by drugs. This is part 1 of a 2-part review of the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of atrial fibrillation. The second part will be published in the subsequent issue of Cardiology in Review."

False,twentysix percent athletes controls latent iron deficiency without anemia symptomsnanathletes disease,11183845,iron,athletes,"Iron status was studied in 126 female endurance athletes and 52 control subjects, all aged 16-20 years. The study aimed at identifying factors responsible for iron deficiency. Twenty-six percent of athletes and 50% of controls had latent iron-deficiency without anemia symptoms. A too low intake of iron (especially heme iron: 0.3 mg daily), and of nutrients influencing iron metabolism, were identified as main causes of iron deficiency in control subjects. In athletes, whose iron intake was sufficient (14.6 mg), the principal cause of iron deficiency were blood losses due to menstruation. High level of physical activity, expressed as training volume and experience, did not adversely affect iron stores, as these were higher than in control subjects and the incidence of iron deficiency was much lower than in the control group. It was concluded that an increased intake of iron and of dietary factors involved in iron metabolism prevented possible exercise-induced losses of iron in young athletes."

Patients were randomized to receive 0.1 mg/kg IV morphine, 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine infiltrated subcutaneously, or inhaled 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen (Entonox) via a demand valve. We assessed pain by measuring visual analog scale pain scores before and during drain removal. Median (25th, 75th centile) visual analog scale pain scores associated with drain removal in the bupivacaine, Entonox, and morphine groups were 9.5 mm (3, 18 mm), 37.0 mm (13, 56 mm), and 15.0 mm (7, 27 mm), respectively.

The antifibrotic effects of sirolimus are seen in animal models but have not been described in liver transplant recipients. We reviewed 1274 liver recipients from 2002 to 2010 and identified a cohort of HCV recipients exposed to sirolimus as primary immunosuppression (SRL Cohort) and an HCV Control Group of recipients who had never received sirolimus. Yearly protocol biopsies were done recording fibrosis stage (METAVIR score) with biopsy compliance of >80% at both year one and two. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the SRL Cohort had significantly less advanced fibrosis (stage ≥2) compared to the HCV Control Group at year one (15.3% vs. 36.2%, p < 0.0001) and year two (30.1% vs. 50.5%, p = 0.001). Because sirolimus is sometimes discontinued for side effects, the SRL Cohort was subgroup stratified for sirolimus duration, showing progressively less fibrosis with longer sirolimus duration. Multivariate analysis demonstrated sirolimus as an independent predictor of minimal fibrosis at year one, and year two. This is the first study among liver transplant recipients with recurrent HCV to describe the positive impact of sirolimus in respect of reduced fibrosis extent and rate of progression."

False,meantime asenapine option management manic andor mixed symptoms patients bipolar disorder may particular value patients high risk metabolic abnormalities nan,21323396,asenapine,metabolic abnormalities,"Asenapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent available in sublingual formulations (5 or 10 mg) and indicated in the US (Saphris) for the acute treatment, as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, of manic and mixed episodes and in the EU (Sycrest) for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes, in adult patients with bipolar I disorder. In two large (both n = 480), well designed, 3-week trials in adult patients with bipolar I disorder, asenapine monotherapy was significantly more effective than placebo at improving mania symptoms, as assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale total score (YMRS; primary endpoint), with significant differences between the asenapine and placebo groups occurring after 2 days of treatment. In both trials, Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) scale mania severity scores exceeded those of placebo. In one trial, response and remission rates exceeded those of placebo. In a 9-week extension study that recruited completers from the monotherapy trials, there were no significant differences between asenapine and olanzapine groups in terms in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, CGI-BP mania severity scores, YMRS response rates or YMRS remission rates during the extension phase. In the extension study, the efficacy of asenapine monotherapy appeared to be maintained over 40 weeks (total treatment duration of 52 weeks). In a 12-week trial of asenapine as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate, asenapine was more effective than placebo in improving manic symptoms, based on the difference between groups in the YMRS total score at week 3 (primary endpoint). Most adverse events associated with asenapine were of mild to moderate severity, with <7% of asenapine recipients experiencing serious adverse events (vs 7% with placebo). In a pooled analysis of the monotherapy trials, the most common adverse events (occurring in ≥ 5% of patients and at twice the incidence of placebo) reported during acute phase asenapine monotherapy for bipolar mania were somnolence, dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS, other than akathisia) and increased bodyweight, which were similar in nature to those occurring during longer-term monotherapy with asenapine. EPS did not worsen in severity during longer-term asenapine monotherapy. Asenapine had minimal effects on plasma glucose, lipid and prolactin levels over both short- and longer-term treatment periods, and had little pro-arrhythmogenic potential. Further active comparator trials and longer-term tolerability and safety data are required. In the meantime, asenapine is a further option for the management of manic and/or mixed symptoms in patients with bipolar I disorder and may be of particular value for patients who are at high risk for metabolic abnormalities."
True,aspirin group complication gastrointestional symptoms mainly epigastric pain frank bleeding observednan,7798824,aspirin,epigastric pain,"The comparative study of the efficacy of coumadin and aspirin in primary cardioembolic stroke prevention of chronic rheumatic heart disease (mitral stenosis) with atrial fibrillation was conducted at Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the trial. Allocation of patients into coumadin or aspirin groups depended upon the patients' choice. Nineteen patients were given coumadin at the adjusted dosage to maintain the therapeutic range of International Normalised Ratio between 1.5-3. Sixty patients were given aspirin at the fixed dosage of 75 mg per day. Six patients were lost to follow-up over the 3 yr period; four in the aspirin group and 2 in the coumadin group. There were three patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke in the aspirin group but none in the coumadin group after three years of follow-up. Six patients had mitral valve replacement during the study (i.e. three patients in each group). There were complications in 12 patients, 10 in the aspirin (16.6 per cent) and 2 in the coumadin (10.5 per cent) group. The complications in coumadin group were minor bleeding over the thigh in one patient and generalised ecchymosis over the whole body in one other. In the aspirin group, the complication was gastrointestional symptoms, mainly epigastric pain, but no frank bleeding was observed. Primary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in chronic rheumatic heart disease was found to be more effective with coumadin than aspirin. Our study does not support the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiac embolism in chronic rheumatic heart disease."
False,ivermectin treatment appears appropriate method control recrudescence infection area parasite reservoir virtually eliminated vector control core area ocpnan,2198750,Ivermectin,infection,"Community trials were started to address questions concerning the safety of ivermectin during large scale treatment, its potential for transmission control, its effect in preventing ocular onchocercal disease, its acceptability and the organization of large scale treatment. A summary is presented of the major, latest results on the short-term epidemiological impact of large scale ivermectin treatment, as observed in eight community trials undertaken in the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP). Ivermectin treatment resulted in a 96%-99% reduction in the mean load of microfilariae (mf) in the skin in treated patients. The subsequent mf-repopulation of the skin was faster than in the clinical trials and after 12 months the mean loads had returned to more than 40% of the pre-treatment load. Ocular mf loads were also greatly reduced and a post-treatment regression of early lesions of the anterior segment of the eye was observed. The transmission of Onchocerca volvulus was reduced by some 60% during the first year after treatment in one trial but no additional reduction was observed after the second treatment round. These results, and other recent research findings, have been used to quantify an epidemiological model for the transmission and control of onchocerciasis. Preliminary results of computer simulations of the predicted long-term epidemiological impact of large scale ivermectin treatment indicate that ivermectin treatment may play a very important role in disease control but that it is unlikely to become a practical tool for transmission control in endemic foci. Ivermectin treatment appears to be the most appropriate method for control of recrudescence of infection in an area where the parasite reservoir has been virtually eliminated by vector control, such as in the core area of the OCP."
False,rationale combining insulin oral drug therapy derives better understanding pathophysiology niddm mechanisms action oral drugs available type diabetic patients insulindeficient insulinresistant thus requiring quite high doses exogenous insulin peripheral insulin delivery leads hyperinsulinaemia could play role pathogenesis late diabetic complications sulphonylureas stimulate insulin release directly portal vein could also potentiate peripheral insulin action metformin improving glucose metabolism insulin sensitivity alphaglucosidase inhibitors slowing digestion complex carbohydrates sucrose able reduce amounts insulin needed control postprandial hyperglycaemianan,8212978,metformin,diabetic,"Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) appears to be an heterogeneous disorder characterized by both relative insulin deficiency and impaired insulin action. The initial management of NIDDM should include patient education, dietary counselling and individualized programs of physical activity. It is only when such measures fail that drug therapy should be considered. Oral drug therapies include sulphonylurea derivatives, biguanides, among which metformin remains the only one commercialized in our country, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose. However, insulin therapy may be required to achieve adequate glycaemic control in some patients, the so-called secondary failures to oral treatment. The rationale for combining insulin and oral drug therapy derives from a better understanding of the pathophysiology of NIDDM and of the mechanisms of action of the oral drugs available: 1) type 2 diabetic patients are both insulin-deficient and insulin-resistant, thus requiring quite high doses of exogenous insulin; 2) peripheral insulin delivery leads to hyperinsulinaemia which could play a role in the pathogenesis of late diabetic complications; 3) sulphonylureas stimulate insulin release directly into the portal vein and could also potentiate peripheral insulin action; and 4) metformin (by improving glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity) and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (by slowing down the digestion of complex carbohydrates and sucrose) are able to reduce the amounts of insulin needed to control postprandial hyperglycaemia. Numerous studies have shown that a combination of insulin and sulphonylurea is more effective than insulin alone in the treatment of patients with NIDDM after secondary failure to oral drugs, leading to better glucose profiles and/or decreased insulin needs. The available data suggest that combination therapy is most beneficial in the diabetic patient who still has residual insulin secretory capacity and that the best scheme comprises an evening injection of lente insulin and the administration of sulphonylureas before meals. Preliminary results suggested that insulin-metformin (when obesity is present) or insulin-acarbose (when post-prandial hyperglycaemia occurs) combinations might offer some favourable features for the treatment of NIDDM patients although these therapeutical approaches still require adequate evaluation in further controlled studies. The additional cost of such combined therapy should be weighed against the potential advantages of better metabolic control."

True,randomised clinical trials observational studies shown increased risk myocardial infarction stroke hypertension heart failure treatment cyclooxygenase inhibitors cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause four diseases including stroke,16586083,cyclooxygenase inhibitors,stroke,"Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with concomitant risk factors. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal, vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time. A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance-specific differences, which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin-independent effects. Diagnostic markers such as N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or high-sensitive C-reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity."

True,chart review potential features myocarditis pericarditis cardiomyopathy children adolescents treated clozapine nan,15319023,clozapine,myocarditis,"Clozapine is known to cause cardiac side effects, including myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy. Prompted by a case of clozapine-related pericarditis in an adolescent, we undertook a retrospective chart review to discover whether any unrecognized cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy were among the children, adolescents, and young adults we had treated with clozapine. The sample comprised a total of 36 patients, who were monitored regularly over a period ranging from 2.5 to 79 months. The average observation period was 7.5 months. Patients were assessed for potential indicators of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. In more than 66% of all patients, at least one of several parameters potentially indicative of pericarditis, myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy was abnormal in at least one instance during the observation period. In all cases in which abnormalities were discovered, the abnormalities were found to be unspecific for myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. With the exception of the case which prompted our study, none of the patients were found to have developed any such disorder in the course of further treatment with clozapine."
False,twelve postmenopausal women suffering advanced breast cancer plasma estrogens androgens cortisol gonadotropins determined therapy treatment megestrol acetate oral doses escalated  mgnan,9816328,cortisol,breast cancer,"Twelve postmenopausal women suffering from advanced breast cancer had plasma estrogens, androgens, cortisol, and gonadotropins determined before therapy and during treatment with megestrol acetate (MA) in oral doses escalated from 40 to 160 mg. The plasma clearance and production rate of estrone and estrone sulfate were determined before treatment and after 4 weeks of therapy with 160 mg MA. Treatment with MA suppressed plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, and cortisol in a dose-dependent manner to <10% of pretreatment values. Plasma testosterone, estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate were suppressed to 18-29% of pretreatment values, whereas the gonadotropins were suppressed to 35-52%. The plasma clearance rates of estrone and estrone sulfate were increased by a mean value of 23.7% (P < 0.01) and 23.5% (P < 0.025), whereas the production rates were reduced by 76.7% (P < 0.0005) and 76.1% (P < 0.0005), respectively. Our findings indicate that MA causes profound suppression of adrenal steroid production but in addition suppresses ovarian secretion of androgens in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. The reduction in plasma estrogens is comparable to values obtained with commonly used aromatase inhibitors and may be responsible for its antitumor effects in breast cancer."
True,androgens affect growth prostate gland many prostate cancers nan,8263129,Androgens,prostate cancers,"Androgens affect growth of the prostate gland and many prostate cancers. Androgens could mediate their mitogenic effects on prostate cells by an autocrine loop involving epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha that bind to the EGF/TGF-alpha receptor. We examined the effects of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone (T), EGF, and EGF-alpha on cell proliferation and 3H-thymidine incorporation in an androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cell line, ALVA101, in serum-free medium. The regulation of TGF-alpha and EGF/TGF-alpha receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were determined by Northern blot analysis and EGF/TGF-alpha receptor protein by immunoblot. After 24 h of treatment of ALVA101 cells with DHT (10(-8) M) or T (10(-8) M), TGF-alpha mRNA levels increased 3- and 2.5-fold, respectively, and EGF/TGF-alpha receptor mRNA levels 2- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Cell numbers increased at day 5 in response to 10(-8) M DHT (18%, P < 0.01), 10(-8) M T (15%, P < 0.01), 20 ng/ml EGF (16%, P < 0.01), and 50 ng/mL TGF-alpha (34%, P < 0.01). DHT combined with TGF-alpha or T combined with EGF increased cell number 43% and 40% above control, respectively (P < 0.01 vs. DHT, P < 0.05 vs. TGF-alpha, T, EGF alone). The anti-EGF/TGF-alpha receptor antibody (528) blocked the cell proliferation induced by either DHT or TGF-alpha. We conclude that DHT and T stimulate synthesis of TGF-alpha and EGF/TGF-alpha receptor mRNAs and EGF/TGF-alpha receptor content in ALVA101 cells. This mitogenic effect of androgen on ALVA101 cells may involve TGF-alpha and the EGF/TGF-alpha receptor autocrine loop."

True,conclude mood anxiety fluctuations related levodopa dosing robust pharmacologic placebo effectsnan,7675241,levodopa,anxiety,"We investigated the effect of levodopa on mood and anxiety in eight Parkinson's disease patients with motor fluctuations. Each patient received 0.0-, 0.5-, and 1.0-mg/kg/hr levodopa infusions in randomly assigned order under double-blind conditions on consecutive days. Mood elevation and anxiety reduction based on half-hourly patient rating and a corresponding increase in tapping speed occurred with active drug infusion but not placebo infusion. The effects were dose related. The higher-dose infusion rate produced more rapid onset, greater magnitude, and longer duration of response. We conclude that mood and anxiety fluctuations related to levodopa dosing are robust pharmacologic, and not placebo, effects."

Eighty-three of the 105 MRSA strains (79%) were clustered in the six genomic groups of phylogenic branch I; and 154 of the 166 MSSA strains (92.8%) were clustered in the 14 genomic groups of phylogenic branches II, III, and IV. Agreement between genomic group and two other markers, esterase type and phage group, was obtained, emphasizing the clonal structure of the population. The genomic groups were delineated by esterase type. The distribution of the strains within the genomic groups was independent of their geographical origin; French strains were clustered with strains from other countries. The three types of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) complex were distributed according to genomic groups. Most of the time, type I and type II SCCmec complexes were found in the MRSA strains belonging to the same genomic groups. In contrast, the type III SCCmec complex was specific to the MRSA strains belonging to the three genomic groups characterized by a common esterase type."

True,quetiapine appears increased risk sedation bodyweight gain albeit less olanzapine nan,11772153,olanzapine,bodyweight gain,"Antipsychotics are frequently used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Atypical antipsychotics have come to the forefront in child psychiatry due largely to their tolerability profiles as well as their efficacy. Potential treatment options include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. A number of studies investigating the use of clozapine have been published in children; however, owing to the frequent monitoring required for agranulocytosis, the use of clozapine may be restricted to patients with treatment-refractory disease. With accumulating data on the development of glucose intolerance in adults receiving clozapine, closer monitoring of bodyweight and fasting blood glucose is imperative. Clozapine also has an increased seizure risk, therefore a baseline electroencephalogram should be performed, as well as continued vigilance for this adverse effect. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that is generally well tolerated and numerous studies have been published investigating this drug in children. Unlike clozapine, its receptor interaction profile lends itself toward increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinaemia. Bodyweight gain is a common adverse effect, although somewhat less than that reported with olanzapine. Baseline liver function studies prior to initiation of this medication are recommended. Risperidone-induced mania has been reported in adults and, therefore, increased caution should be used when deciding to treat children and adolescents with risperidone, particularly in those with a predisposition toward mania. Olanzapine, like risperidone, has also been associated with onset of mania in adults. Olanzapine has a receptor profile that results in significant risk for bodyweight gain and sedation. Furthermore, this drug has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance; thus, it is important to monitor bodyweight and fasting blood glucose on a frequent basis. Less information is known about quetiapine in children and adolescents. Reports about its efficacy and tolerability vary. Quetiapine appears to have increased risk for sedation and bodyweight gain, albeit less than that of olanzapine. The compound appears to be less likely to induce EPS. Finally, ziprasidone has recently been approved for use in the adult population. This compound, in terms of its receptor profile, has more in common with risperidone. This suggests a potential for increased risk of EPS and hyperprolactinaemia. It also has an increased risk of QTc prolongation; thus, a baseline electrocardiogram is suggested, particularly in those patients with a history of cardiovascular illness. Lack of evidence for bodyweight gain with ziprasidone is a considerable advantage."

Contact with the skin can result in percutaneous absorption of the substance that inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and can induce acetaldehyde syndrome in case of alcohol use. The purpose of this report is to describe two cases of a disulfiram-like syndrome following occupational exposure to hydrogen cyanamide. The first case involved a 59-year-old man who used Dormex, which contains hydrogen cyanamide, without protection after consuming a large amount of alcohol during a meal. In less than 1 hour after the ingestion of alcohol, he developed malaise with flushing of the face, tachycardia, and dyspnea. Manifestations regressed spontaneously under surveillance in the hospital. The second case occurred in a 55-year-old farmer following cutaneous contact with Dormex. Five hours after exposure, he developed disulfiram-like syndrome with flushing, tachycardia, and arterial hypotension after consuming three glasses of wine. The patient recovered spontaneously in 3 hours under surveillance in the hospital. These cases confirm the necessity of avoiding alcohol consumption as recommended in the instructions for use of Dormex and of preventing cutaneous contact during use."

Clinical examination and laboratory investigations excluded viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, granulomatous disease, primary biliary disease, extrahepatic biliary obstruction, and heart failure. Liver biopsy showed severe intrahepatic and canalicular cholestasis with minimal inflammatory changes. The patient's jaundice promptly resolved with therapy for hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm as bilirubin levels decreased from 35 mg/dL (normal: 0.5-1.2 mg/dL) to 0.4 mg/dL. Thyrotoxicosis can be an uncommon cause of profound cholestasis. Our case differs from all other reports in the literature because of the severity of the cholestasis and its prompt resolution with treatment for thyrotoxicosis."
False,open randomised crossover study investigated effect single mg oral dose entacapone novel catecholomethyltransferase comt inhibitor pharmacokinetics metabolism levodopa carbidopa cardiovascular responses blood pressure pulse rate variation standard stimuli eight parkinsonian patientsnan,8112370,levodopa,parkinsonian,"In an open, randomised, cross-over study we investigated the effect of a single 200 mg oral dose of entacapone, a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of levodopa/carbidopa, and on the cardiovascular responses (blood pressure and pulse rate variation to standard stimuli) in eight parkinsonian patients. Entacapone significantly increased the mean area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of levodopa by 46%, from 3620 to 5280 h.ng.ml-1 and prolonged its elimination half-life (t1/2el) from 1.5 h to 2.0 h. The mean AUC of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), the monoamine oxidase-dependent metabolite of levodopa, was significantly increased from 122 to 343 h.micrograms.ml-1 by entacapone. A small decrease in the AUC of homovanillic acid (HVA), the COMT dependent metabolite of levodopa, was observed (from 455 to 303 h.ng.ml-1). Entacapone also decreased the excretion of HVA but not that of 3-methoxytyramine in the urine. Cardiovascular autonomic responses to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli were not changed by entacapone. We conclude that a single dose of entacapone moderately increases the AUC and prolongs the t1/2el of levodopa in man and that that does not affect cardiovascular autonomic regulation."
False,levels crash mrna significantly upregulated tumors compared normal breast tissues correlate lack estrogen receptor expression tumors nan,14654938,estrogen,tumors,"We have identified CRASH, a human asparaginase-like protein which is composed of 308 amino acids and exhibits 32% homology to human aspartylglucosaminadase at the amino acid level. Database analysis revealed that the gene corresponding to CRASH is composed of 7 exons and 6 introns. Steady-state level of CRASH mRNA was found to be increased in 5 cell lines derived from metastatic lesions compared with 2 cell lines derived from primary mammary carcinoma and HMEC (human mammary epithelial cells). We found that the mRNA level of CRASH correlates with the metastatic propensity of several isogenic human colon cancer and pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. CRASH corresponds to a recently identified sperm autoantigen and furthermore we have demonstrated inducibility of CRASH mRNA by androgen and progesterone. Investigation of several types of human cancers and their corresponding normal tissues revealed high levels of CRASH mRNA in uterine, mammary and ovarian tumors compared with the corresponding normal tissues. CRASH mRNA expression was analysed in breast cancer samples with disclosed clinico-pathological features and corresponding normal tissues. The levels of CRASH mRNA were significantly up-regulated in tumors compared with normal breast tissues and correlate with lack of estrogen receptor expression of the tumors."
False,pregabalin peripheral neuropathic pain results multicenter noncomparative openlabel study indian patientsnan,16939547,Pregabalin,neuropathic pain,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the tolerability, safety and efficacy of pregabalin in Indian patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. In this prospective, multicenter, non-comparative, open-label study, patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (n = 111) received pregabalin in doses ranging from 75 to 300 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. Primary efficacy measures included weekly pain score and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Despite a short study duration, a significant reduction was seen in weekly pain score (p < 0.0001), as well as VAS score of SF-MPQ (p < 0.0001). Significant improvements were also seen in other pain-related endpoints, weekly sleep interference score, quality of life measures, and patient and clinician ratings of global improvement. Pregabalin was well tolerated, and the most common adverse events were dizziness and somnolence. The short study duration precluded the assessment of longer term safety issues such as weight gain. This study has demonstrated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of pregabalin for peripheral neuropathic pain in Indian patients."
True,neostigmine given intrathecally inhibits breakdown endogenous spinal neurotransmitter acetylcholine thereby inducing analgesia nan,23185923,Neostigmine,analgesia,"The spinal route of analgesia has consolidated its place as a major modality in the management of both acute and chronic pain. The search for ideal additives to local anaesthetic agents to prolong the analgesic effects poses a challenge to the anaesthetists. Neostigmine, an anticholinesterase, presents a novel approach to providing analgesia. Neostigmine, when given intrathecally, inhibits breakdown of an endogenous spinal neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, thereby inducing analgesia. We aimed to determine the analgesic and adverse effects of intrathecal neostigmine combined with hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl."
True,thrombosis rare wellrecognized potential complication factor viii inhibitor bypass activity feiba infusionnan,15456478,FEIBA,Thrombosis,"Thrombosis is a rare but well-recognized potential complication of Factor VIII Inhibitor Bypass Activity (FEIBA) infusion. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is increasingly used as an alternative to FEIBA; however, the thrombotic safety profile of rFVIIa remains incompletely characterized. To determine the incidence rates of thrombotic adverse events (AEs) after infusion of rFVIIa and FEIBA. Data from the MedWatch pharmacovigilance program of the US Food and Drug Administration, as supplemented by published case reports, were used in conjunction with estimated numbers of infusions available from manufacturers to assess comparative incidence of thrombotic AEs in patients receiving rFVIIa or FEIBA in the period from April 1999 through June 2002. Reported thrombotic AEs were rare, with incidence rates of 24.6 per 10(5) infusions (CI, 19.1-31.2 per 10(5) infusions) for rFVIIa and 8.24 per 10(5) infusions (CI, 4.71-13.4 per 10(5) infusions) for FEIBA. Thrombotic AEs were significantly more frequent in rFVIIa than FEIBA recipients (incidence rate ratio, 2.98; CI, 1.71-5.52). The most commonly documented single type of thrombotic AE after rFVIIa infusion was cerebrovascular thrombosis, while myocardial infarction was the most frequent type in patients receiving FEIBA. Contrasting AE reporting patterns between rFVIIa and FEIBA may have contributed to the observed difference in thrombotic event incidence. Nevertheless, this comprehensive pharmacovigilance assessment does not support superior thrombotic safety of rFVIIa and suggests that thrombotic AE risk may be higher in rFVIIa than FEIBA recipients."
False,cpt-11 produced statistically significant tumor linesnan,8996518,CPT-11,tumor,"Therapy of patients with malignant central nervous system tumors is frequently unsuccessful, reflecting limitations of current surgical, radiotherapeutic, and pharmacotherapeutic treatments. The camptothecin derivative irinotecan (CPT-11) has been shown to possess antitumor activity in phase II trials for patients with carcinoma of the lung, cervix, ovary, colon, or rectum and for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The current study was designed to test the efficacy of the drug against a panel of human tumor xenografts derived from adult and pediatric central nervous system malignancies. Tumors included childhood high-grade gliomas (D-212 MG, D-456 MG), adult high-grade gliomas (D-54 MG, D-245 MG), medulloblastomas (D341 Med, D487 Med), ependymomas (D528 EP, D612 EP), and a rhabdomyosarcoma (TE-671), as well as sublines with demonstrated resistance to busulfan (D-456 MG (BR)), cyclophosphamide (TE-671 CR), procarbazine (D-245 MG (PR)) or melphalan (TE-671 MR), growing subcutaneously and intracranially in athymic nude mice. In replicate experiments, CPT-11 was given at a dosage of 40 mg/kg per dose via intraperitoneal injection in 10% dimethylsulfoxide on days 1-5 and 8-12, which is the dosage lethal to 10% of treated animals. CPT-11 produced statistically significant (P < 0.001) growth delays in all subcutaneous xenografts tested, including those resistant to busulfan, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, and melphalan, with growth delays ranging from 21.3 days in D487 Med to 90+ days in several tumor lines. Further, tumor regression was evident in every treated animal bearing a subcutaneous tumor, with some xenografts yielding complete tumor regression. Statistically significant (P < 0.001) increases in survival were demonstrated in the two intracranial xenografts-D341 EP (73.0% increase) and D-456 MG (114.2% increase)-treated with CPT-11. These studies demonstrate that, of over 40 drugs evaluated in this laboratory, CPT-11 is the most active against central nervous system xenografts and should be advanced to clinical trial as soon as possible."
False,tramadol weak opioid effects adrenergic serotonergic neurotransmission used treat cancer pain chronic non malignant pain nan,8766220,Tramadol,pain,"Tramadol is a weak opioid with effects on adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission that is used to treat cancer pain and chronic non malignant pain. This drug was initiated in association with paroxetine and dosulepine hydrochloride in a tetraparetic patient with chronic pain. Fifty-six days after initiation of the treatment the patient presented hallucinations that only stopped after the withdrawal of psycho-active drugs and tramadol. The case report questions the long term use of pain killers combined with psycho-active drugs in chronic non malignant pain, especially if pain is under control."
True,twentyone consecutive cancer patients morphine induced delirium underwent opioid rotation fentanylnan,16043013,morphine,opioid rotation,"Although recent studies suggest that opioid rotation could be an effective treatment strategy for morphine-induced delirium, there have been no prospective studies to investigate the treatment effects of opioid rotation using fentanyl. The primary aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in symptom palliation of morphine-induced delirium. Twenty-one consecutive cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium underwent opioid rotation to fentanyl. Physicians recorded the symptom severity of delirium (the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, MDAS), pain, and other symptoms (categorical verbal scale from 0: none to 3: severe) and the Schedule for Team Assessment Scale (STAS) (from 0: none to 4: extreme); and performance status at the time of study enrollment and three and seven days after. Of 21 patients recruited, one patient did not complete the study. In the remaining 20 patients, morphine was substituted with transdermal fentanyl in 9 patients and parenteral fentanyl in 11 patients. Total opioid dose increased from 64 mg oral morphine equivalent/day (Day 0) to 98 mg/day (Day 7), and the median increase in total opioid dose was 42%. Treatment success, defined as an MDAS score below 10 and pain score of 2 or less, was obtained in 13 patients on Day 3 and 18 patients on Day 7. The mean MDAS score significantly decreased from 14 (Day 0) to 6.4 and 3.6 (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Pain scores significantly decreased from 2.2 (Day 0) to 1.3 and 1.1 on the categorical verbal scale (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001); from 2.6 (Day 0) to 1.6 and 1.3 on the STAS (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Symptom scores of dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting significantly decreased, and performance status significantly improved. Opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl may be effective in alleviating delirium and pain in cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium."

True,results show key role gaba ar subunit dephosphorylation downregulation gabaergic synaptic transmission brain ischemia contributing neuronal death nan,24513087,GABA,neuronal death,"Cerebral ischemia is characterized by an early disruption of GABAergic neurotransmission contributing to an imbalance of the excitatory/inhibitory equilibrium and neuronal death, but the molecular mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Here we report a downregulation of GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) expression, affecting both mRNA and protein levels of GABA(A)R subunits, in hippocampal neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro model of ischemia. Similar alterations in the abundance of GABA(A)R subunits were observed in in vivo brain ischemia. OGD reduced the interaction of surface GABA(A)R with the scaffold protein gephyrin, followed by clathrin-dependent receptor internalization. Internalization of GABA(A)R was dependent on glutamate receptor activation and mediated by dephosphorylation of the β3 subunit at serine 408/409. Expression of phospho-mimetic mutant GABA(A)R β3 subunits prevented receptor internalization and protected hippocampal neurons from ischemic cell death. The results show a key role for β3 GABA(A)R subunit dephosphorylation in the downregulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission in brain ischemia, contributing to neuronal death. GABA(A)R phosphorylation might be a therapeutic target to preserve synaptic inhibition in brain ischemia."
True,cytotoxicity due exposure ndma partially inhibited antioxidants nacetylcysteine ascorbic acid butylated hydroxyanisole n-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone potentiated upon glutathione depletionnan,9498284,NDMA,cytotoxicity,"GM0637, a human fibroblast cell line, was transfected with pCMV2E1, an expression vector containing the full length cDNA for rat cytochrome P450 2E1 (P450 2E1), and with pCMVneo, which contained vector alone, and the selected clones were designated GM2E1 and GMneo, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that GM2E1, but not GMneo, expressed a protein that reacted with anti-human P450 2E1 antibody. The 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase,p-nitrophenol hydroxylase, and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) demethylase activities of the P450 in these cells were measured in monolayer cell cultures without preparing microsomes. Exposure of the GM2E1 cells to NDMA for 4 days caused severe decreases in cell viability, as determined by crystal violet uptake, and showed a sigmoidal dose-response curve with a median lethal dose of 17 microM. In contrast, the viability of GMneo cells was not altered by NDMA even at concentrations up to 10 mM. Time- and concentration-dependent methylation of DNA, RNA and protein by [14C]NDMA was only observed in cells expressing P450 2E1. Inhibitors of P450 2E1 activity such as ethanol, 4-methylpyrazole, and isoniazid caused a 90% decrease in the methylation of cellular macromolecules and also completely protected the cells against NDMA-mediated toxicity. The cytotoxicity due to exposure to NDMA was partially inhibited by antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole and N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone but was not potentiated upon glutathione depletion. These results document the ability of rat P450 2E1 to metabolize NDMA to toxic reactive intermediates and demonstrate that this cell line provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of metabolism-mediated toxicity and carcinogenesis."
True,silicone commonly used cosmetic procedures owing presumed inertness yield serious sequelae including acute embolization pneumonitis nan,22288970,Silicone,pneumonitis,"Silicone, commonly used in cosmetic procedures owing to its presumed inertness, can yield serious sequelae including acute embolization and pneumonitis. Chronic pulmonary sequelae in response to silicone injection have not been previously described. We report a case of chronic progressive granulomatous pneumonitis in response to subcutaneous silicone injections in a transgender male-to-female patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). After receiving silicone injections to the buttock, the patient developed rapid onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and chills. Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse peripheral interstitial opacities. She responded symptomatically to prednisone with subsequent intermittent symptomatic flares. Four years later, she developed marked dyspnea and cough. Chest computed tomography showed progressive diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities. Lung biopsies demonstrated numerous spheroid silicone particles within the lung interstitium and small pulmonary vessels, surrounded by foreign body giant cells and nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation. We speculate that HIV-1-infected patients may be at risk for chronic, progressive granulomatous pneumonitis due to silicone injection years after their procedure owing to shifting levels of cell-mediated immunity."
True,tacrine administered licl pretreated rats induces electrocorticographic seizures delayed hippocampal damage nan,19944736,Tacrine,hippocampal damage,"The purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound. A Tween 80-coated poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system, able to trespass the BBB. Tacrine, administered in LiCl pre-treated rats, induces electrocorticographic seizures and delayed hippocampal damage. The toxic effects of tacrine-loaded poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles (5mg/kg), a saline solution of tacrine (5mg/kg) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i.p. administration in LiCl-pre-treated Wistar rats. All the animals treated with tacrine-loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms, i.e. epileptic onset, with respect to those animals treated with the free compound (10 min vs. 22 min respectively). In addition, tacrine-loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage of neuronal cells in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals, while the saline solution of tacrine only in 60% of animals. Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control (saline-treated) group of animals. In conclusion, the evaluation of time-to-onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the tacrine-lithium model of epilepsy in the rat, could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass (or not) the BBB in vivo."
False,chromosomal translocations tyrosine kinase abl gene chromosome may generate oncogenic kinases exhibiting constitutive tyrosine kinase activitynan,14987801,tyrosine,ABL,"Chromosomal translocations of tyrosine kinase c-ABL gene from chromosome 9 may generate oncogenic kinases exhibiting constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Recently, we have shown that ABL-fusion oncogenic tyrosine kinases, BCR/ABL and TEL/ABL, specific to hematopoietic malignances, induced resistance to DNA-damaging agents. To elucidate the role of DNA repair in this phenomenon we examined the capacity of murine BaF3 lymphoid cells and their TEL/ABL-transformed counterparts to repair DNA lesions caused by gamma- and UV-radiations and the anti-cancer drug, idarubicin. TEL/ABL-transformed cells displayed resistance to these DNA damaging agents as evaluated by MTT assay and the survival advantage was associated with an accelerated kinetics of DNA repair as measured by the alkaline comet assay. Deoxyribonucleosides (dNTPs) supplementation of the repair medium further stimulated DNA repair and the effect was specific to the DNA damage agent used in the experiment but only the transformed cells displayed this feature. A variety of damages induced imply the multi-pathway of DNA repair involved. We also examined the capability of BCR/ABL-fusion to modulate the repair of oxidative lesions, considered as a major side effect of various anti-cancer drugs including idarubicin and radiation. Employing the free radical scavenger alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN, a spin trap) and DNA repair enzymes: endonuclease III (EndoIII) that nicks DNA at sites of oxidized bases, we found that BCR/ABL-transformed cells repaired oxidative DNA lesions more effectively than control cells. Our results suggest, that oncogenic ABL-dependent stimulation of DNA repair may contribute to the cell resistance to genotoxic treatment."
False,human osteosarcoma mg cells cultured tissue culture dish various ca concentrations evaluate effect ca concentration calcium depositionnan,16674304,calcium,Human osteosarcoma,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Ca(2+) concentration in culture medium on the promotion of osteogenesis by MG63 osteoblast-like cells and to prepare bone-like tissues by supplying Ca(2+)-enriched medium to MG63 cells immobilized in three-dimensional gelatin hydrogels. Human osteosarcoma MG63 cells were cultured on tissue culture dish under various Ca(2+) concentrations to evaluate the effect of Ca(2+) concentration on calcium deposition. When Ca(2+) concentration was 8 mM, the maximum calcium deposition was obtained at day 28. Then MG63 cells were entrapped in gelatin hydrogels cross-linked by transglutaminase and cultured for 28 days, either in a standard culture medium or in medium containing 8 mM Ca(2+). Effects of Ca(2+)-enriched medium on osteoblastic phenotype of MG63 cells in gelatin hydrogels were analyzed in terms of cell number, calcium deposition content, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. The characteristics of calcified gelatin hydrogels were evaluated by x-ray diffraction (XRD), histological analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After 28 days of culture, no significant difference in cell numbers was found between the different culture conditions. However, calcium content of gelatin hydrogels with cells cultured in Ca(2+)-enriched media was significantly higher than that of hydrogels with cells cultured in standard Ca(2+) concentration medium. After 14 days of culture, ALP activity of cells cultured in Ca(2+)-enriched media was down-regulated compared with that of cells cultured in standard Ca(2+) concentration media. XRD analysis indicated the formation of hydroxyapatite in gelatin hydrogels cultured in the Ca(2+)-enriched media at day 14, and the XRD pattern of the composite at day 21 was almost similar to that of mouse tibia. Moreover, histological analysis and SEM analysis revealed that cross-sections of hydrogels cultured in Ca(2+)-enriched media had an organic/mineral layer structure analogous to that of mouse tibia."
True,addition oestrogens play important role breast cancer development oestrone sulphate es might main source active oestrogens breastnan,10823131,oestrogens,breast cancer,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional regulator of cellular growth and differentiation in many cell types and has a growth inhibitory effect on mammary epithelial cells. The TGF-beta 2 isoform has been shown to be present in high concentrations in breast cyst fluid and might have a protective role in breast cancer. In addition, oestrogens play an important role in breast cancer development, and oestrone sulphate (E1S) might be the main source of active oestrogens in the breast. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of TGF-beta 2 on oestrogen synthesis in an attempt to understand the mechanism by which TGF-beta 2 may exert a protective effect in breast cancer. In this study, higher concentrations of TGF-beta 2 significantly inhibited the conversion of E1S to oestrone (E1) and the conversion of E1 to the potent oestrogen, oestradiol (E2). TGF-beta 2 did not have any effect on MCF-7 cell growth or on E2 to E1 conversion. In conclusion, TGF-beta 2 might exert a protective role in breast cancer by reducing the amount of active oestrogens present in the breast."

False,combination diet exercise followed metformin early phase insulin resistance may reduce delay atherosclerosis arteriosclerosis complications associated diabetesnan,22399368,metformin,atherosclerosis,"Excess total and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain very high among those with type 2 diabetes versus those without diabetes. Clinical trials to lower blood glucose have been disappointing probably because the participants were too late in the natural history of diabetes and already had extensive vascular disease. Insulin resistance measured simply by elevated fasting blood insulin is an early marker of β-cell stress and peripheral insulin resistance. Metformin will prevent development of diabetes among patients with impaired fasting glucose but only for the short term. Metformin reduces risk of coronary heart disease. The drug is safe, low cost, and may also prevent cancer. The combination of diet and exercise followed by metformin in the early phase of ""insulin resistance"" may reduce or delay both atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis complications associated with diabetes. Preventive therapy must begin much earlier than before clinical diagnosis of diabetes and aim to initially lower blood insulin levels or insulin resistance."

True,juvenile huntington disease exacerbated methylphenidate case reportnan,18658080,methylphenidate,Juvenile Huntington disease,"The authors describe the case of an 8-year-old boy, otherwise healthy, who presented with symptoms consistent with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and was started on a trial of methylphenidate. Within 4 weeks, he experienced a rapid decline in fine motor skills, with dysarthria, intention tremor, motor impersistence, and diffusely increased tone. Symptoms persisted despite cessation of methylphenidate. At that time, a paternal history of Huntington disease was disclosed. Molecular analysis revealed an expansion in CAG repeats to 75 copies, within the range characteristic of juvenile Huntington disease. This report raises the possibility that use of dopaminergic agonists in patients with a family history of Huntington disease may lead to clinical exacerbation of motor symptoms and/or unwitting diagnosis in an unprepared family."
True,report case hypotension bradycardia asystole intravenous administration highdose methylprednisolone yearold patient underwent electrocardiographic ecg monitoring throughout episodenan,10074612,methylprednisolone,asystole,"We report a case of hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole after intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone in a 73-year-old patient who underwent electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring throughout the episode. There was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earlier. The patient was admitted with a pulmonary-renal syndrome with hemoptysis, rapidly progressive renal failure, and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient recovered cardiac rhythm. The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia. This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP). These mechanisms are not well understood because, in most cases, the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event. Rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here, and the authors discount ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism."
False,calcium channel blockers ccbs attractive alternatives thiazides patients uncontrolled intolerant thiazides specific indications agents eg angina severe diastolic dysfunctionnan,1687447,thiazides,angina,"The evaluation and treatment of hypertension in the African-American patient with an elevated blood pressure presents a diagnostic challenge. We are less able to rely on young age and resistance to treatment as indications for more extensive evaluation of secondary causes of hypertension; thus, greater reliance on history, physical examination, and clinical judgment is required if we are to identify potentially treatable causes. The treatment of hypertension in the African-American patient also presents a therapeutic challenge. Thiazide diuretics remain the drugs of first choice for treating hypertension in the African-American hypertensive. The calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are attractive alternatives to thiazides in patients uncontrolled by or intolerant of thiazides or who have specific indications for these agents (eg, angina, severe diastolic dysfunction). Beta-blockers should not be denied to African-American hypertensives if indications for their use exist. Although beta-blockers may be less effective as monotherapy, 50% of African-American hypertensives can be so controlled. Resistance to beta-blockers may be eliminated by administering them with a diuretic. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), like CCBs, are well tolerated, but also lack long-term primary prevention data. As is the case with beta-blockers, ACEIs are less effective in African-American hypertensives when used as monotherapy. ACEIs have particular value in therapy for African-American hypertensives with concomitant congestive heart failure and may protect against progression of diabetic nephropathy. Finally, all hypertensives, especially African-American hypertensives, should have access to treatment prior to the development of end organ damage. The cost of early intervention is minimal compared with the economic consequences of neglect."

We describe two recipients of lung allografts from the same donor who had M. hominis pleuropulmonary infection during the immediate postoperative period. The most likely source of infection in these cases was the donor's respiratory tract. The slow-growing pinpoint colonies formed by M. hominis on routine bacterial culture medium may be easily overlooked and should be subcultured to mycoplasmal medium for definitive identification. The recommended management of this infection consists of drainage and antimicrobial therapy with tetracycline, clindamycin, or a fluoroquinolone. This report highlights the potential for M. hominis to be transmitted from donor to recipient during organ transplantation."

Recent studies revealed that changes in mitochondria membrane fluidity might have a direct impact on membrane-based processes such as fission-associated morphogenic changes, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore or oxidative phosphorylation at the complexes of the electron transport chain. We investigated synaptosomal plasma and mitochondrial membranes isolated from brains of mouse models for ageing, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Membrane properties are disease specifically altered, identifying mitochondrial membranes as targets for possible therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative diseases.

False,found abovementioned patient one diabetic kindreds history wernickes encephalopathy abnormal transketolase determined km tpp nan,3762968,TPP,Wernicke's encephalopathy,"We studied a thiamine-dependent enzyme, transketolase, from fibroblasts of a diabetic patient who developed Wernicke's encephalopathy when treated with tolazamide, in order to delineate if this patient also had transketolase abnormality [high Km for thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)], as previously reported in postalcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. In addition to this patient, we also studied this enzyme from three diabetic kindreds without any history of Wernicke's encephalopathy and from four normal controls. We found that the above-mentioned patient and one of the diabetic kindreds with no history of Wernicke's encephalopathy had abnormal transketolase as determined by its Km for TPP. These data suggest a similarity between postalcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and the patient with tolazamide-induced Wernicke's encephalopathy from the standpoint of transketolase abnormality."
True,epothilones new class mti may associated grade peripheral neuropathy however neuropathy associated ixabepilone novel epothilone analog generally mild moderate reversible baseline grade levelsnan,18567992,epothilone B,neuropathy,"Microtubule inhibitor (MTI)-based chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer--including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones--are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone."

True,importantly ectopic expression mkp effectively attenuated cisplatin induced jnk activation cytotoxicity nan,24675421,cisplatin,cytotoxicity,"The elucidation of chemoresistance mechanisms is important to improve cancer patient survival. In this report, we investigated the role and mechanism through which receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), a mediator in cell survival and death signaling, participates in cancer's response to chemotherapy. In lung cancer cells, knockdown of RIP1 substantially increased cisplatin-induced apoptotic cytotoxicity, which was associated with robust JNK activation. The expression of the JNK inactivating phosphatase, MKP1, was substantially reduced in RIP1 knockdown cells. Although MKP1 protein stability was not altered by RIP1 suppression, the synthesis rate of MKP1 was dramatically reduced in RIP1-suppressed cells. Furthermore, we found that the expression of miR-940 was substantially increased in RIP1 knockdown cells. Knockdown of miR-940 restored MKP1 expression and attenuated cisplatin-induced JNK activation and cytotoxicity. Importantly, ectopic expression of MKP1 effectively attenuated cisplatin-induced JNK activation and cytotoxicity. In addition, activation of the JNK upstream signaling kinase, MKK4, was also potentiated in RIP1 knockdown cells. Altogether, our results suggest that RIP1 contributes to cisplatin resistance by suppressing JNK activation that involves releasing miR-940-mediated inhibition of MKP1 and suppressing activation of MKK4. Intervention targeting the RIP1/miR-940/MKP1/JNK pathway may be used to sensitize platinum-based chemotherapy. "

The structures of new compounds were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analyses and comparison with literature. Compounds 1-17 were examined for their inhibitory effects on Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation induced with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, a known primary screening test for inhibitors of tumor promotion. Four compounds, 1, (23E)-3β,7β-dihydroxy-25-methoxycucurbita-5,23-dien-19-al (2), karavilagenin D (11), and 12, showed potent inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction with IC(50) values in the range of 242-264 mol ratio/32 pmol TPA. In addition, compounds 1 and 11 exhibited inhibitory effects on skin-tumor promotion in an in vivo two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis test based on 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) as initiator, and with TPA as a promoter. Furthermore, upon evaluation of the cytotoxic activities of compounds 1-17 against human cancer cell lines, compounds 2, 5-7, 9, and 14 showed potent activities against HL60 cell line, and compound 2 against SK-BR-3 cell line."

Prolongation of QT interval, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents, but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem, an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for hypertension. The patient was in near syncope and had QT-interval prolongation. After discontinuing cisapride, the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur. We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, including diltiazem."

True,yearold man treated oxacillin one week staphylococcus aureus bacteremia developed renal failure diffuse symmetric palpable purpuric lesions feetnan,11337188,oxacillin,renal failure,"A 67-year-old man who was treated with oxacillin for one week because of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, developed renal failure and diffuse, symmetric, palpable purpuric lesions on his feet. Necrotic blisters were noted on his fingers. Skin biopsies showed findings diagnostic of leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Oxacillin was discontinued and patient was treated with corticosteroids. The rash disappeared after three weeks and renal function returned to normal. Leucocytoclastic vasculitis presents as palpable purpura of the lower extremities often accompanied by abdominal pain, arthralgia, and renal involvement. Etiologic factors or associated disorders include infections, medications, collagen vascular disease and neoplasia. However, in half of the cases no etiologic factor is identified. Usually it is a self-limited disorder, but corticosteroid therapy may be needed in life-threatening cases since early treatment with corticosteroids in severe cases can prevent complications. Oxacillin should be included among the drugs that can cause leucocytoclastic vasculitis."

False,neuronal synthase nnos overexpressing neuroblastoma cell line exposed differentiative action retinoic acid slowed proliferation accelerated differentiation towards neuronal phenotypenan,15331636,NO,neuroblastoma,"Nitric oxide (NO) has been found to act as an important negative regulator of cell proliferation in several systems. We report here that NO negatively regulates proliferation of neuronal cell precursors and promotes their differentiation by downregulating the oncogene N-Myc. We have studied this regulatory function of NO in neuroblastoma cell lines (SK-N-BE) and in primary cerebellar granule cell cultures. In a neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) overexpressing neuroblastoma cell line exposed to the differentiative action of retinoic acid, NO slowed down proliferation and accelerated differentiation towards a neuronal phenotype. This effect was accompanied by a parallel decrease of N-Myc expression. Similar results could be obtained in parental SK-N-BE cells by providing an exogenous source of NO. Pharmacological controls demonstrated that NO's regulatory actions on cell proliferation and N-Myc expression were mediated by cGMP as an intermediate messenger. Furthermore, NO was found to modulate the transcriptional activity of N-Myc gene promoter by acting on the E2F regulatory region, possibly through the control of Rb phosphorylation state, that we found to be negatively regulated by NO. In cerebellar granule cell cultures, NOS inhibition increased the division rate of neuronal precursors, in parallel with augmented N-Myc expression. Because a high N-Myc expression level is essential for neuroblastoma progression as well as for proliferation of neuronal precursors, its negative regulation by NO highlights a novel physiopathological function of this important messenger molecule."
True,treatment mtx often causes toxicity necessitate dose reduction treatment cessationnan,23222202,MTX,toxicity,"Methotrexate (MTX) is an important component of therapy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Treatment with MTX often causes toxicity, which can necessitate dose reduction or treatment cessation. Interindividual differences in adverse reactions can be due to different factors, including polymorphisms in key genes. Recently, we confirmed the association between SLCO1B1 rs11045879 polymorphism and toxicity previously proposed by Treviño and colleagues. As SLCO1B1 is a transporter involved in MTX elimination, other polymorphisms in genes from this pathway could also have a role in MTX toxicity. The aim of the present study was to analyze in depth the role of polymorphisms in the genes of the MTX transport pathway as putative toxicity predictors in pediatric ALL."

Iron ions produced cytotoxicity towards both kinds of cells dependent on its concentration. Catalase suppressed the cytotoxicity induced by iron ions in Lu106 cells. whereas in CLV102 and Mel8 cells, was ineffective. By contrast, superoxide dismutase abolished the cytotoxicity of iron ions towards CLV102 cells, whereas in Lu106 and Mel8 cells, was ineffective. The mixture of iron ions with ascorbic acid was less cytotoxic than iron ions themselves or ascorbic acid itself, only in CLV102 and Lu106 cells. Ascorbic acid enhanced drastically cytotoxic effect of copper ions in all kinds of cells."

An assay combining cell culture and real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is reported here to verify drug efficacy against C. parvum in vitro. The monolayers of Human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-8) were infected by sporozoites excysted directly on the cells and were incubated with monensin, halofuginone bromide and hexadecylphosphocholine until 45h post infection (p.i.). The genomic DNA was extracted at 3, 27 and 45h p.i. and subjected to qPCR targeting the 70kDa heat shock protein gene to quantify the development of C. parvum. The reliability of the method was validated by testing of monensin and halofuginone bromide, which are well known to be effective in vitro. With the dose dependency monensin and halofuginone showed a maximum inhibition of 98.15% and 98.05% at 0.144 and 25microM, respectively, compared with non-treated controls at the endpoint incubation, confirming previous reports. The reduction of the parasite DNA reproduction over 27h p.i. compared with 3h p.i. was found to be as 97-99% in 0.144microM monensin and 99% in 25microM halofuginone treated cells. The new antileishmanial compound hexadecylphosphocholine (24.5microM, Miltefosine) showed 78-98% inhibition at 45h p.i., however, the reproduction of parasite DNA was reduced to 96-98% over 27h p.i.

In our hospital, three different concentrations of ropivacaine solution (0.1%, 0.15%, 0.2%) in combination with 1 microg/mL fentanyl were available for PCEA. As some studies have reported a much higher incidence of motor block and opioid-related side effects with 0.2% ropivacaine in combination with 4 microg/mL fentanyl, it was our intent to analyze the data of our patients who had received PCEA after upper abdominal surgery. In addition to comparing the analgesic effects and the incidence of motor block and opioid-related side effects of these three different ropivacaine/fentanyl solutions, we also evaluated the workload of our pain staff. The main purpose of our study was to determine which of these three regimens of ropivacaine was most satisfactory with the least workload for the pain service staff."

Recently, nanotheranostics are of significant clinical interest as these nanomedicines offer new opportunities to directly visualize drug blood circulation and biodistribution, thus facilitating the development of more personalized treatment regimens. To date, much research has shown the exciting potential of nanotheranostics in cancer therapy and imaging. In particular, the advancements of polymeric nanomaterials in the past decades have paved the way for the development of cancer nanotheranostics that are primarily comprised of polymers or conjugates of polymer and other types of nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, and magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Additionally, to improve the therapeutic and diagnostic efficiency of cancer nanotheranostics, various strategies have been utilized to provide targeted-delivery across biological barriers and environmental-responsive delivery, leading to the alteration of pharmacokinetics such as drug distribution, cellular partition, and elimination routes. In this review, we will summarize recent development of polymer-based cancer nanotheranostics and some novel strategies to improve their pharmacokinetics, especially biodistribution, followed by a brief discussion of their applications in cancer therapies as well as their toxicity and safety.

False,particular following topics highlighted chemistry sources reactive oxygen species antioxidant defense mechanisms signaling events mediated reactive oxygen species role reactive oxygen species hypertension putative therapeutic role antioxidants cardiovascular disease nan,15030300,oxygen,cardiovascular disease,"The cellular metabolism of oxygen generates potentially deleterious reactive oxygen species, including superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical. Under normal physiologic conditions, the rate and magnitude of oxidant formation is balanced by the rate of oxidant elimination. However, an imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants results in oxidative stress, which is the pathogenic outcome of the overproduction of oxidants that overwhelms the cellular antioxidant capacity. There is growing evidence that increased oxidative stress and associated oxidative damage are mediators of vascular injury in cardiovascular pathologies, including hypertension, atherosclerosis and ischemia-reperfusion. This development has evoked considerable interest because of the possibilities that therapies targeted against reactive oxygen intermediates by decreasing the generation of reactive oxygen species and/or by increasing availability of antioxidants may be useful in minimizing vascular injury. This review focuses on the vascular actions of reactive oxygen species, the role of oxidative stress in vascular damage in hypertension and the therapeutic potential of modulating oxygen radical bioavailability in hypertension. In particular, the following topics will be highlighted: chemistry and sources of reactive oxygen species, antioxidant defense mechanisms, signaling events mediated by reactive oxygen species, role of reactive oxygen species in hypertension and the putative therapeutic role of antioxidants in cardiovascular disease."

Patients were randomized to receive pravastatin 10 mg or matching placebo with doubling of the dose after 8 weeks if predefined target levels for total cholesterol [(i.e., < 5.2 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) or > 15% decrease from baseline] had not been achieved. At Week 16, pravastatin-treated patients showed a 21.4% decrease in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a 13.5% reduction in serum total cholesterol (TC) concentrations (p < 0.001 compared with placebo). Levels of triglycerides (TG) were reduced 9.6% during pravastatin treatment (p < 0.05 compared with placebo) while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were increased 4.4% (p = NS). Adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities were similar among patients treated with pravastatin or placebo. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels remained unchanged. The results of this study demonstrate that low-dose pravastatin is effective and well tolerated for lowering elevated cholesterol concentrations during short-term treatment of patients with NIDDM and hypercholesterolemia."
True,investigate factors influencing effects addressed three questions intensity dizziness nausea nin unsteadiness dependent nicotine dosagenan,17990061,nicotine,nausea,"Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."
False,although recent studies suggest opioid rotation could effective treatment strategy morphineinduced delirium prospective studies investigate treatment effects opioid rotation using fentanyl nan,16043013,fentanyl,delirium,"Although recent studies suggest that opioid rotation could be an effective treatment strategy for morphine-induced delirium, there have been no prospective studies to investigate the treatment effects of opioid rotation using fentanyl. The primary aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in symptom palliation of morphine-induced delirium. Twenty-one consecutive cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium underwent opioid rotation to fentanyl. Physicians recorded the symptom severity of delirium (the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, MDAS), pain, and other symptoms (categorical verbal scale from 0: none to 3: severe) and the Schedule for Team Assessment Scale (STAS) (from 0: none to 4: extreme); and performance status at the time of study enrollment and three and seven days after. Of 21 patients recruited, one patient did not complete the study. In the remaining 20 patients, morphine was substituted with transdermal fentanyl in 9 patients and parenteral fentanyl in 11 patients. Total opioid dose increased from 64 mg oral morphine equivalent/day (Day 0) to 98 mg/day (Day 7), and the median increase in total opioid dose was 42%. Treatment success, defined as an MDAS score below 10 and pain score of 2 or less, was obtained in 13 patients on Day 3 and 18 patients on Day 7. The mean MDAS score significantly decreased from 14 (Day 0) to 6.4 and 3.6 (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Pain scores significantly decreased from 2.2 (Day 0) to 1.3 and 1.1 on the categorical verbal scale (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001); from 2.6 (Day 0) to 1.6 and 1.3 on the STAS (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Symptom scores of dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting significantly decreased, and performance status significantly improved. Opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl may be effective in alleviating delirium and pain in cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium."

False,transdermal fentanyl initiated based hour opioid requirement adequate analgesia achievednan,14583070,fentanyl,analgesia,"Transdermal fentanyl is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of chronic pain caused by malignancy and non-malignant conditions when administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Compared with oral opioids, the advantages of transdermal fentanyl include a lower incidence and impact of adverse effects (constipation, nausea and vomiting, and daytime drowsiness), a higher degree of patient satisfaction, improved quality of life, improved convenience and compliance resulting from administration every 72 hours, and decreased use of rescue medication. Transdermal fentanyl is a useful analgesic for cancer patients who are unable to swallow or have gastrointestinal problems. Transdermal fentanyl forms a depot within the upper skin layers before entering the microcirculation. Therapeutic blood levels are attained 12-16 hours after patch application and decrease slowly with a half-life of 16-22 hours following removal. Patients with chronic pain should be titrated to adequate relief with short-acting oral or parenteral opioids prior to the initiation of transdermal fentanyl in order to prevent exacerbations of pain or opioid-related adverse effects. Transdermal fentanyl can then be initiated based on the 24-hour opioid requirement once adequate analgesia has been achieved. The prolonged elimination of transdermal fentanyl can become problematic if patients develop opioid-related adverse effects, especially hypoventilation. Adverse effects do not improve immediately after patch removal and may take many hours to resolve. Patients who experience opioid-related toxicity associated with respiratory depression should be treated immediately with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone and closely monitored for at least 24 hours. Because of the short half-life of naloxone, sequential doses or a continuous infusion of the opioid antagonist may be necessary. Transdermal fentanyl should be administered cautiously to patients with pre-existing conditions such as emphysema that may predispose them to the development of hypoventilation. Transdermal fentanyl is indicated only for patients who require continuous opioid administration for the treatment of chronic pain that cannot be managed with other medications. It is contraindicated in the management of acute and postoperative pain, as pain may decrease more rapidly in these circumstances than fentanyl blood levels can be adjusted, leading to the development of life-threatening hypoventilation. Cognitive and physical impairments such as confusion and abnormal co-ordination can occur with transdermal fentanyl. Therefore, patients should be instructed to refrain from driving or operating machinery immediately following the initiation of transdermal fentanyl, or after any dosage increase. Patients may resume such activities once the absence of these potential adverse effects is documented."
False,erb nonsteroidal estrogen receptor beta ligand evaluated several pain animal models involving nerve injury sensitization nan,18559275,estrogen,pain animal models involving nerve injury or sensitization,"The effects of estrogens on pain perception remain controversial. In animal models, both beneficial and detrimental effects of non-selective estrogens have been reported. ERb-131 a non-steroidal estrogen receptor beta ligand was evaluated in several pain animal models involving nerve injury or sensitization. Using functional and binding assays, ERb-131 was characterized as a potent and selective estrogen receptor beta agonist. In vivo, ERb-131 was devoid of estrogen receptor alpha activity as assessed in a rat uterotrophic assay. ERb-131 alleviated tactile hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin, and reversed tactile allodynia caused by spinal nerve ligation and various chemical insults. Moreover, ERb-131 did not influence the pain threshold of normal healthy animals. Thus, estrogen receptor beta agonism is a critical effector in attenuating a broad range of anti-nociceptive states."

The low rate of sustained response of chronic hepatitis with current therapies, underscores the need for new therapeutic options. It has been suggested that thymalfasin may have efficacy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C. Pilots studies in patients with chronic hepatitis B treated with thymalfasin in combination with interferon or nucleoside analogue, showed a 70% complete sustained response rate. Studies in chronic hepatitis C patients, would indicate that thymalfasin in combination with standard or pegylated interferon with ribavirin may improve response rate in hepatitis C virus (HCV) naïve and nonresponder patients. However, a large phase-III randomized study conducted in Europe in HCV patients nonresponder to Peg-interferon with ribavirin, demonstrated that thymalfasin did not improve the rate of sustained virologic responses, but, in patients who completed therapy, thymalfasin significantly diminished the relapse rate.

False,additionally  paracetamol treated rats developed hyperplasia bladder epithelium coincident presence bladder calculi nan,4090988,paracetamol,bladder calculi,"Groups of male and female inbred Leeds strain rats were fed diets containing either 0.5% or 1.0% paracetamol by weight for up to 18 months. At the 1.0% dosage level, 20% of rats of both sexes developed neoplastic nodules of the liver, a statistically significant incidence. These rats also showed gross enlargement of their livers and an increase in foci of cellular alteration, the latter also being observed in the low dosage male rats. Papillomas of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all paracetamol-treated groups, and three rats bore bladder carcinomas. However, significant yields of bladder tumours were only obtained from low dosage females and high dosage males. Additionally, 20 to 25% of paracetamol-treated rats developed hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium, which was not coincident with the presence of bladder calculi. A low yield of tumours at various other sites also arose following paracetamol feeding. An electron microscope study of the livers of paracetamol-treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known hepatocarcinogens."

False,twentysix percent athletes controls latent iron deficiency without anemia symptomsnan,11183845,iron,anemia,"Iron status was studied in 126 female endurance athletes and 52 control subjects, all aged 16-20 years. The study aimed at identifying factors responsible for iron deficiency. Twenty-six percent of athletes and 50% of controls had latent iron-deficiency without anemia symptoms. A too low intake of iron (especially heme iron: 0.3 mg daily), and of nutrients influencing iron metabolism, were identified as main causes of iron deficiency in control subjects. In athletes, whose iron intake was sufficient (14.6 mg), the principal cause of iron deficiency were blood losses due to menstruation. High level of physical activity, expressed as training volume and experience, did not adversely affect iron stores, as these were higher than in control subjects and the incidence of iron deficiency was much lower than in the control group. It was concluded that an increased intake of iron and of dietary factors involved in iron metabolism prevented possible exercise-induced losses of iron in young athletes."

False,report two hepatitis virus hbv carriers liver failure withdrawal corticosteroids steroids administered treatment serious asthmatic attacksnan,1600269,corticosteroids,hepatitis B,We report two hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers who had liver failure after withdrawal of corticosteroids (steroids) administered for treatment of serious asthmatic attacks. Liver functions deteriorated 1 to 2 wk after withdrawal of the steroid therapy and liver failure occurred. Steroid readministration and intensive therapy for liver failure did not prevent death. An excessive immune response provoked by steroid withdrawal and decreased reserve capacity due to underlying chronic liver disease were thought to be factors in the liver failure. Caution must be exercised in the administration of steroids to patients with underlying chronic HBV infection to prevent exacerbation of hepatitis. Prompt readministration of steroids is indicated if evidence of liver failure develops.

True,plasma gaba concentration appear useful marker susceptibility benzodiazepine induced cognitive toxicity elderlynan,15672555,benzodiazepine,cognitive toxicity,"The GABA system is an active target for drugs to treat a variety of disorders and the availability of an indirect measure of central GABA activity would not only enhance psychiatric research, but also permit assessment of the pharmacodynamic effects of drugs designed to act on this system. The relationships between plasma baseline pre-drug GABA concentrations and cognitive impairments induced by an acute oral dose of lorazepam (0.5 and 1.0 mg) were investigated in 22 healthy elderly individuals. Partial correlations controlling for plasma lorazepam concentrations revealed no significant relationship between baseline plasma GABA levels and lorazepam-induced impairments on tests of cognitive functioning. Plasma GABA concentration does not appear to be a useful marker of susceptibility to benzodiazepine-induced cognitive toxicity in the elderly. Other approaches to estimating central GABA activity should be pursued."
True,nephroprotective effect coenzyme investigated mice acute renal injury induced single ip injection cisplatin mgkgacute renal injury induced cisplatin injection,20510337,cisplatin,acute renal injury,"The nephroprotective effect of coenzyme Q10 was investigated in mice with acute renal injury induced by a single i.p. injection of cisplatin (5 mg/kg). Coenzyme Q10 treatment (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was applied for 6 consecutive days, starting 1 day before cisplatin administration. Coenzyme Q10 significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels which were increased by cisplatin. Coenzyme Q10 significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms (reduced glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity), suppressed lipid peroxidation, decreased the elevations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide and platinum ion concentration, and attenuated the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in renal tissue resulted from cisplatin administration. Also, histopathological renal tissue damage mediated by cisplatin was ameliorated by coenzyme Q10 treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that coenzyme Q10 significantly decreased the cisplatin-induced overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor-kappaB, caspase-3 and p53 in renal tissue. It was concluded that coenzyme Q10 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity commonly encountered in clinical practice."

Single photon emission tomography with i.v. 133Xe was used to measure the rCBF changes. The dyskinetic parkinsonian patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non-dyskinetic parkinsonian patients, with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi- and contralateral primary motor areas. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement, like L-dopa-induced peak dose dyskinesia, is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop."

True,analyzed daily basis mean chill score meperidine dosage pulse rise also higher addition nausea vomiting  patients received rapid infusion versus  patients received slow infusion less appeared common received amphotericin rapidlynan,1590686,meperidine,vomiting,"Results of a double-blind randomized non-crossover study of rapid (45 min) versus slow (4 h) infusion of amphotericin B administered to 20 patients with proven or suspected fungal infection are reported. Toxicity was higher in the rapid infusion group than it was in the slow infusion group (mean total 7-day chill score, 173 +/- 276 versus 20 +/- 30 [P less than 0.01]; mean total 7-day dosage of meperidine required to abate rigors, 180 +/- 133 versus 58 +/- 78 mg [P less than 0.05]; and mean maximum total 7-day pulse rise, 225 +/- 64 versus 135 +/- 56 beats per min [P less than 0.02], respectively). When analyzed on a daily basis, the mean chill score, meperidine dosage, and pulse rise were also higher; and in addition, nausea and vomiting (5 of 11 patients who received a rapid infusion versus 0 of 9 patients who received a slow infusion [P less than 0.01]) appeared to be more common in those who received amphotericin B rapidly. The daily analysis approach proved that tolerance to these side effects developed with each subsequent infusion day, and by day 7 the incidence and severity were the same. This development of tolerance was significant for the mean chill score in the rapid infusion group (P less than 0.05) and for the proportion of patients with chills (P less than 0.005 for the slow infusion group; P less than 0.05 for the rapid infusion group). A decrease in creatinine clearance to greater than 51% of the baseline value was seen in two patients in each group. There were five deaths (four in the rapid infusion group, 1 in the slow infusion group) within 1 month, but none was clearly related to the amphotericin B infusion. The mean time to defervescence was similar for each group (10.8 +/- 4.1 days in the slow infusion group versus 9.9 +/- 5 days in the rapid infusion group). A rapid infusion regimen for amphotericin B cannot be recommended, at least during the first 5 to 7 days of treatment."
False,moreover alcohol abuse produce cardiac arrhythmias hypertension cardiomyopathy stroke even sudden deathnan,9751945,alcohol,alcohol abuse,"The ingestion of one or two alcoholic drinks can affect heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, myocardial contractility, and regional blood flow. These actions generally are not clinically important. In the presence of cardiovascular disease, however, even such small quantities of alcohol might result in transient unfavorable hemodynamic changes. Moreover, alcohol abuse can produce cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, stroke, and even sudden death. In contrast, moderate alcohol use produces changes that have an overall favorable effect on atherosclerotic-related vascular diseases. Because cardiovascular disease due to atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in Western society, this desirable effect of alcohol use outweighs its detrimental actions, resulting in favorable findings in population studies. Nevertheless, the body of evidence argues against encouraging alcohol use for its cardiovascular effects."
False,naloxone mgkg iv reversed respiratory paralysis glutamate gaba levels control values brain stem cortex changes caudate cerebellumnan,2893236,GABA,respiratory paralysis,"No agent is yet available to reverse respiratory paralysis produced by CNS depressants, such as general anesthetics. In this study naloxone reversed respiratory paralysis induced by thiopental in rats. 25 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate, increased GABA, decreased glutamate, and had no effect on aspartate or glycine levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem. Pretreatment of rats with thiosemicarbazide for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of thiopental. 50 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced respiratory arrest with further increase in GABA and decrease in glutamate again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the amino acids studied in four regions of rat brain. Naloxone (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) reversed respiratory paralysis, glutamate and GABA levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum. These data suggest naloxone reverses respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental and involves GABA in its action."

True,episodes hypotension transient reduction splanchnic perfusion common patients treated remifentanil compared receiving fentanyl opioid regimennan,17285425,remifentanil,hypotension,"The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of fentanyl and remifentanil on splanchnic perfusion during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Fifty patients were randomized to receive either fentanyl (10 microgxkg(-1) at induction and 5 microgxkg(-1)xh(-1) infusion for maintenance) or remifentanil (3 microgxkg(-1) at induction and 1 microgxkg(-1)xmin(-1) infusion for maintenance). Patients in both groups were comparable with regard to demographics. Intraoperative volume management and inotropic therapy were similiar in both groups. Regarding heart rate, there were no significant differences between the groups at any measurement time (P > 0.05). Compared to the fentanyl group, the remifentanil group showed a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure during induction. Also, the gastric intramucosal CO(2) pressure (Pg(CO) (2)) and the P(CO) (2)-gap, defined as the difference between Pg(CO) (2) and Pa(CO) (2), were significantly increased and the gastric mucosal pH (pHi) was significantly decreased in the remifentanil group in the postinduction period (P < 0.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences in respiratory data at any time between the two groups (P > 0.05). Both fentanyl and remifentanil seemed to be effective and well tolerated in this CABG population. Episodes of hypotension and transient reduction in splanchnic perfusion were more common in patients treated with remifentanil when compared to those receiving the fentanyl opioid regimen."
True,smaller doses ascorbic acid eg intravenously toxic doses probably reduce mortality systemic chromium poisoning nan,10382555,chromium,poisoning,"Repeated topical exposure to chromium(VI) may cause an allergic contact dermatitis or the formation of chrome ulcers. Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III)."

Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."

False,pretreatment myeloid leukemia line hl alltrans retinoic acid atra upregulated aqp leading significantly increased arsenic uptake asoinduced cytotoxicity incubation aso might explain synergism atra asonan,16968895,ATRA/all-trans retinoic acid,myeloid leukemia,"Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is highly efficacious in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Aquaglyceroporin 9 (AQP9) is a transmembrane protein that may be involved in arsenic uptake. In 10 of 11 myeloid and lymphoid leukemia lines, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and Western blotting showed that AQP9 expression correlated positively with As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. As a proof-of-principle, transfection of EGFP-tagged AQP9 to the hepatoma line Hep3B, not expressing AQP9 and As2O3 insensitive, led to membrane AQP9 expression and increased As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. Similarly, the chronic myeloid leukemia line K562 expressed low levels of AQP9 and was As2O3 insensitive. The K562(EGFP-AQP9) transfectant accumulated significantly higher levels of intracellular arsenic than control K562(EGFP) when incubated with As2O3, resulting in significantly increased As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of the myeloid leukemia line HL-60 with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) up-regulated AQP9, leading to a significantly increased arsenic uptake and As2O3-induced cytotoxicity on incubation with As2O3, which might explain the synergism between ATRA and As2O3. Therefore, AQP9 controlled arsenic transport and might determine As2O3 sensitivity. Q-PCR showed that primary APL cells expressed AQP9 significantly (2-3 logs) higher than other acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), which might explain their exquisite As2O3 sensitivity. However, APL and AML with maturation expressed comparable AQP9 levels, suggesting that AQP9 expression was related to granulocytic maturation."

False,active principle marijuana deltatetrahydrocannabinol thc shown wide therapeutic application number important medical conditions including pain anxiety glaucoma nausea emesis muscle spasms wasting diseasesnan,11448725,Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol/THC,glaucoma,"The active principle in marijuana, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has been shown to have wide therapeutic application for a number of important medical conditions, including pain, anxiety, glaucoma, nausea, emesis, muscle spasms, and wasting diseases. Delta(9)-THC binds to and activates two known cannabinoid receptors found in mammalian tissue, CB1 and CB2. The development of cannabinoid-based therapeutics has focused predominantly on the CB1 receptor, based on its predominant and abundant localization in the CNS. Like most of the known cannabinoid agonists, Delta(9)-THC is lipophilic and relatively nonselective for both receptor subtypes. Clinical studies show that nonselective cannabinoid agonists are relatively safe and provide therapeutic efficacy, but that they also induce psychotropic side effects. Recent studies of the biosynthesis, release, transport, and disposition of anandamide are beginning to provide an understanding of the role of lipid transmitters in the CNS. This review attempts to link current understanding of the basic biology of the endocannabinoid nervous system to novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention. This new knowledge may facilitate the development of cannabinoid receptor-targeted therapeutics with improved safety and efficacy profiles."
True,additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness nausea ie nicotine increases sensitivity motion sicknessnan,17990061,nicotine,dizziness,"Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."

False,slices drugresistant epileptic patients made hypersynchronoushyperexcitable elevated potassium inhibition gabaa receptors behaved similarlynan,16631625,potassium,epileptic,"Pharmacoresistance in epileptic patients may be ascribed to at least two, not mutually exclusive, mechanisms: a pharmacokinetic mechanism and a decreased sensitivity or availability of targets to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; i.e., carbamazepine and phenytoin (CBZ, PHT)). Brain:plasma drug concentration ratios were determined intraoperatively during lobectomies performed to alleviate drug-resistant seizures. The brain:plasma ratio of CBZ was 1.48 when therapeutic serum levels (15-34 microM) were achieved. When concentrations of CBZ found in multiple-drug-resistant brain were directly applied to human cortical slices from drug-resistant patients made hyperexcitable and hypersynchronous by Mg(2+)-free media, bursting frequency was not significantly affected and overall excitability was reduced by 40%. Similar results were obtained for PHT. At higher AED concentrations (60-200 microM), a dose-dependent decrease of bursting frequency and amplitude was observed. Slices from drug-resistant epileptic patients made hypersynchronous/hyperexcitable by elevated potassium or inhibition of GABA-A receptors behaved similarly. Of note is the response of slices from human multiple-drug-resistant brain, which was greater than in rodent cortex from naive animals. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that multiple drug resistance to AEDs involves cerebrovascular changes that impede the achievement of appropriate drug levels in the central nervous system."

True,kegfpaqp transfectant accumulated significantly higher levels intracellular arsenic control kegfp incubated aso resulting significantly increased asoinduced cytotoxicity nan,16968895,arsenic,cytotoxicity,"Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is highly efficacious in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Aquaglyceroporin 9 (AQP9) is a transmembrane protein that may be involved in arsenic uptake. In 10 of 11 myeloid and lymphoid leukemia lines, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and Western blotting showed that AQP9 expression correlated positively with As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. As a proof-of-principle, transfection of EGFP-tagged AQP9 to the hepatoma line Hep3B, not expressing AQP9 and As2O3 insensitive, led to membrane AQP9 expression and increased As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. Similarly, the chronic myeloid leukemia line K562 expressed low levels of AQP9 and was As2O3 insensitive. The K562(EGFP-AQP9) transfectant accumulated significantly higher levels of intracellular arsenic than control K562(EGFP) when incubated with As2O3, resulting in significantly increased As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of the myeloid leukemia line HL-60 with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) up-regulated AQP9, leading to a significantly increased arsenic uptake and As2O3-induced cytotoxicity on incubation with As2O3, which might explain the synergism between ATRA and As2O3. Therefore, AQP9 controlled arsenic transport and might determine As2O3 sensitivity. Q-PCR showed that primary APL cells expressed AQP9 significantly (2-3 logs) higher than other acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), which might explain their exquisite As2O3 sensitivity. However, APL and AML with maturation expressed comparable AQP9 levels, suggesting that AQP9 expression was related to granulocytic maturation."

After a washout period of at least 3 weeks following fluoxetine discontinuation and an additional 1-week, single-blind, placebo washout period, patients began treatment with 50 mg sertraline once daily. Based on the clinician's judgment of patient response, doses were titrated upward if necessary. The maximum daily dose of sertraline was 200 mg. Depressive symptoms and adverse events were assessed weekly. An interim analysis was conducted of the first 93 patients who completed the study. Of 91 evaluable patients, 69 sertraline-treated patients (75.8%) experienced significant improvement in depression. Only 8 of 93 patients (8.6%) discontinued sertraline because of side effects."

True,realtime monitoring copper ionsinduced cytotoxicity eis cell chipsnan,20547054,copper,cytotoxicity,"An important goal of biomedical research is the development of tools for high-throughput evaluation of drug effects and cytotoxicity tests. Here we demonstrate EIS cell chips able to monitor cell growth, morphology, adhesion and their changes as a consequence of treatment with drugs or toxic compounds. As a case study, we investigate the uptake of copper ions and its effect on two cell lines: B104 and HeLa cells. For further understanding, we also carried out in parallel with EIS studies, a complete characterization of cell morphology and changes induced by copper ions through complementary methodologies (including state-of-the-art AFM, viability test and Western blot). Our results reveal a strong correlation between EIS data and both MTT test and AFM characterization so our chip can be used as powerful tools in all biology lab in combination with other standard methods giving additional information that can be useful in a complete and deep investigation of a biological process. This chip can be used even alone replacing in vitro drug tests based on conventional biochemical methods, being very cheap and reusable and allowing to perform cytotoxicity tests without using any expensive reagent or equipment."
True,haemofiltration indicated particularly aminoglycoside toxicity nan,2056948,aminoglycoside,toxicity,"The role of haemodialysis, haemoperfusion and haemofiltration in the management of poisoned patients is reviewed in light of 15 years' clinical experience. During haemodialysis, blood is pumped across a semipermeable membrane (dialysis) through which the compound diffuses and, during haemoperfusion, through a cartridge that contains activated charcoal to which the compound is adsorbed. During haemofiltration, the constituents of blood that have a relative molecular mass which is below the cut-off point of the hollow fibre membrane (usually less than 40,000) are extracted. Haemofiltration is indicated particularly for aminoglycoside toxicity. The clearance by these three procedures depends on the physicochemical characteristics and kinetics of the toxic compound. In general, if a compound is adsorbed by charcoal, the clearance by haemoperfusion will be higher than that achieved by haemodialysis. Similarly, if a compound is amenable to removal by haemodialysis, its clearance will be greater than that achieved by haemofiltration. The indications for extracorporeal elimination depend on the clinical severity and complications of the overdose, the characteristics of the individual patient and the nature, dose and plasma concentrations of the toxic substance. It is generally accepted that extracorporeal elimination is worthwhile if it increases total body clearance by 30% or more. It has little or no value for intoxication caused by chloroquine, flecainide, methotrexate, paraquat, quinine, and tricyclic antidepressants. The complications of extracorporeal elimination which are encountered most frequently are: hypotension; blood loss; haematomas; metabolic disequilibria; mechanical problems such as air embolism; and, in the case of haemoperfusion, hypocalcaemia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. In practice, the compounds for which extracorporeal elimination is used most frequently are the alcohols, lithium and salicylate (haemodialysis) and theophylline (haemofiltration)."

False,invitro activity azithromycin chlamydia trachomatis infected polarized human endometrial epithelial cellsnan,8383102,azithromycin,Chlamydia trachomatis infected,"The in-vitro activity of azithromycin on Chlamydia trachomatis infected human endometrial epithelial cells, both primary and transformed cells growing in a polarized and non-polarized orientation, was analyzed. Addition of azithromycin two hours after adsorption inoculation with continued exposure until 72 h gave an MIC90 and MBC90 of 0.063 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. In addition, the MBC results were more pronounced in infected cells growing in a polarized orientation. Numerous small fluorescent 'spots' (presumed small abnormal inclusions) were visible in the infected cells exposed to MIC concentrations of azithromycin. Immuno-transmission electron microscopy examination revealed intracellular inclusions filled with chlamydial envelope ghosts. Since standard diagnostic antigen detection methods use anti-envelope antibodies, the aberrant envelope-filled inclusions might be interpreted as viable inclusions by fluorescent microscopy and result in high false positive readings. To simulate treatment of an infected patient, azithromycin was added at 18 h to infected cells containing many reticulate bodies and exposure continued for 54 h after which killing of chlamydiae was seen. The use of polarized human cells may offer a more relevant in-vitro model system for examining the efficacy of antimicrobial action."
False,thus bortezomib could sensitize escc trail apoptosis multiple molecular mechanisms actionnan,20515944,bortezomib,ESCC,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most aggressive human cancers, and novel treatment modalities are required. We investigated the therapeutic potential of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) in combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) on human ESCC cell lines. Bortezomib enhanced the susceptibility to TRAIL in 12 of the 15 ESCC cell lines tested, although most showed low sensitivity to TRAIL as a single agent. The enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by bortezomib was caspase dependent. Increased processing of caspase-8 often accompanied enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by bortezomib. However, the increased cell surface expression of death receptors observed on bortezomib treatment did not seem to be crucial for this effect. For some ESCC, bortezomib treatment resulted in a more efficient recruitment of caspase-8 and the Fas-associated death domain to the death-inducing signaling complex. Additional downregulation of the cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein long isoform [c-FLIP(L)] could cooperate in the activation of the extrinsic pathway in some cases. For other ESCC, the crucial effect of bortezomib treatment seemed to be increased signaling via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway on subsequent exposure to TRAIL. Thus, bortezomib could sensitize ESCC to TRAIL apoptosis by multiple molecular mechanisms of action. Therefore, the combination of bortezomib and TRAIL might be a novel therapeutic strategy for ESCC patients who fail to respond to standard chemoradiotherapy that predominantly targets the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway."

False,numerous studies shown combination insulin sulphonylurea effective insulin alone treatment patients niddm secondary failure oral drugs leading better glucose profiles andor decreased insulin needsnan,8212978,glucose,NIDDM,"Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) appears to be an heterogeneous disorder characterized by both relative insulin deficiency and impaired insulin action. The initial management of NIDDM should include patient education, dietary counselling and individualized programs of physical activity. It is only when such measures fail that drug therapy should be considered. Oral drug therapies include sulphonylurea derivatives, biguanides, among which metformin remains the only one commercialized in our country, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose. However, insulin therapy may be required to achieve adequate glycaemic control in some patients, the so-called secondary failures to oral treatment. The rationale for combining insulin and oral drug therapy derives from a better understanding of the pathophysiology of NIDDM and of the mechanisms of action of the oral drugs available: 1) type 2 diabetic patients are both insulin-deficient and insulin-resistant, thus requiring quite high doses of exogenous insulin; 2) peripheral insulin delivery leads to hyperinsulinaemia which could play a role in the pathogenesis of late diabetic complications; 3) sulphonylureas stimulate insulin release directly into the portal vein and could also potentiate peripheral insulin action; and 4) metformin (by improving glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity) and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (by slowing down the digestion of complex carbohydrates and sucrose) are able to reduce the amounts of insulin needed to control postprandial hyperglycaemia. Numerous studies have shown that a combination of insulin and sulphonylurea is more effective than insulin alone in the treatment of patients with NIDDM after secondary failure to oral drugs, leading to better glucose profiles and/or decreased insulin needs. The available data suggest that combination therapy is most beneficial in the diabetic patient who still has residual insulin secretory capacity and that the best scheme comprises an evening injection of lente insulin and the administration of sulphonylureas before meals. Preliminary results suggested that insulin-metformin (when obesity is present) or insulin-acarbose (when post-prandial hyperglycaemia occurs) combinations might offer some favourable features for the treatment of NIDDM patients although these therapeutical approaches still require adequate evaluation in further controlled studies. The additional cost of such combined therapy should be weighed against the potential advantages of better metabolic control."

True,vorozole like ovariectomy almost completely reduces tumor growth dmba induced mammary carcinoma model ratnan,7726994,DMBA,mammary carcinoma,"Vorozole, the (+)-(S)-isomer of a new triazole compound, is a potent and selective aromatase inhibitor. In vitro, the compound is over a thousandfold more active than aminoglutethimide. In vivo, the compound very potently inhibits ovarian, peripheral, and tumoral aromatase. Vorozole shows an in vitro selectivity margin of 10,000-fold for aromatase inhibition as compared to inhibition of other P450- and non-P450-dependent reactions. This selectivity was confirmed in the rat in vivo. Vorozole, like ovariectomy, almost completely reduces tumor growth in the DMBA-induced mammary carcinoma model in the rat. In postmenopausal women, vorozole very potently inhibits peripheral conversion of androstenedione to estrone. After chronic administration, plasma estradiol levels are reduced while the levels of adrenal gluco- and mineralo-corticoids remain unchanged. Vorozole has excellent oral bioavailability and exerts linear, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics."
False,addition proteasome inhibitor triacsin treatment abolished adrp decrease accumulated polyubiquitinated adrp nan,16230742,triacsin C,ADRP,"Adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) is a major protein associated with lipid droplets in various types of cells, including macrophage-derived foam cells and liver cells. However, the role of ADRP in the processes of formation and regression of these cells is not understood. When J774 murine macrophages were incubated with either VLDL or oleic acid, their content of both ADRP and triacylglycerol (TG) increased 3- to 4-fold. Induction of ADRP during TG accumulation was also observed in oleic acid-treated HuH-7 human liver cells. Addition of triacsin C, a potent inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthase, for 6 h decreased the amount of TG in VLDL-induced foam cells and oleic acid-treated liver cells; it decreased the amount of ADRP protein in parallel, indicating the amount of ADRP reduced during regression of the lipid-storing cells. Addition of a proteasome inhibitor during triacsin C treatment abolished the ADRP decrease and accumulated polyubiquitinated ADRP. In addition, the proteasome inhibitor reversed not only the degradation of ADRP but also TG reduction by triacsin C. These results suggest that cellular amounts of ADRP and TG regulate each other and that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in degradation of ADRP during regression of lipid-storing cells."
True,olanzapine like risperidone also associated onset mania adultsnan,11772153,risperidone,mania,"Antipsychotics are frequently used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Atypical antipsychotics have come to the forefront in child psychiatry due largely to their tolerability profiles as well as their efficacy. Potential treatment options include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. A number of studies investigating the use of clozapine have been published in children; however, owing to the frequent monitoring required for agranulocytosis, the use of clozapine may be restricted to patients with treatment-refractory disease. With accumulating data on the development of glucose intolerance in adults receiving clozapine, closer monitoring of bodyweight and fasting blood glucose is imperative. Clozapine also has an increased seizure risk, therefore a baseline electroencephalogram should be performed, as well as continued vigilance for this adverse effect. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that is generally well tolerated and numerous studies have been published investigating this drug in children. Unlike clozapine, its receptor interaction profile lends itself toward increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinaemia. Bodyweight gain is a common adverse effect, although somewhat less than that reported with olanzapine. Baseline liver function studies prior to initiation of this medication are recommended. Risperidone-induced mania has been reported in adults and, therefore, increased caution should be used when deciding to treat children and adolescents with risperidone, particularly in those with a predisposition toward mania. Olanzapine, like risperidone, has also been associated with onset of mania in adults. Olanzapine has a receptor profile that results in significant risk for bodyweight gain and sedation. Furthermore, this drug has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance; thus, it is important to monitor bodyweight and fasting blood glucose on a frequent basis. Less information is known about quetiapine in children and adolescents. Reports about its efficacy and tolerability vary. Quetiapine appears to have increased risk for sedation and bodyweight gain, albeit less than that of olanzapine. The compound appears to be less likely to induce EPS. Finally, ziprasidone has recently been approved for use in the adult population. This compound, in terms of its receptor profile, has more in common with risperidone. This suggests a potential for increased risk of EPS and hyperprolactinaemia. It also has an increased risk of QTc prolongation; thus, a baseline electrocardiogram is suggested, particularly in those patients with a history of cardiovascular illness. Lack of evidence for bodyweight gain with ziprasidone is a considerable advantage."

The camptothecin derivative irinotecan (CPT-11) has been shown to possess antitumor activity in phase II trials for patients with carcinoma of the lung, cervix, ovary, colon, or rectum and for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The current study was designed to test the efficacy of the drug against a panel of human tumor xenografts derived from adult and pediatric central nervous system malignancies. Tumors included childhood high-grade gliomas (D-212 MG, D-456 MG), adult high-grade gliomas (D-54 MG, D-245 MG), medulloblastomas (D341 Med, D487 Med), ependymomas (D528 EP, D612 EP), and a rhabdomyosarcoma (TE-671), as well as sublines with demonstrated resistance to busulfan (D-456 MG (BR)), cyclophosphamide (TE-671 CR), procarbazine (D-245 MG (PR)) or melphalan (TE-671 MR), growing subcutaneously and intracranially in athymic nude mice. In replicate experiments, CPT-11 was given at a dosage of 40 mg/kg per dose via intraperitoneal injection in 10% dimethylsulfoxide on days 1-5 and 8-12, which is the dosage lethal to 10% of treated animals. CPT-11 produced statistically significant (P < 0.001) growth delays in all subcutaneous xenografts tested, including those resistant to busulfan, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, and melphalan, with growth delays ranging from 21.3 days in D487 Med to 90+ days in several tumor lines. Further, tumor regression was evident in every treated animal bearing a subcutaneous tumor, with some xenografts yielding complete tumor regression. Statistically significant (P < 0.001) increases in survival were demonstrated in the two intracranial xenografts-D341 EP (73.0% increase) and D-456 MG (114.2% increase)-treated with CPT-11. These studies demonstrate that, of over 40 drugs evaluated in this laboratory, CPT-11 is the most active against central nervous system xenografts and should be advanced to clinical trial as soon as possible."

In ten patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and seven patients with other B-cell chronic leukemias (BCL), we have studied the intracellular 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2,5OAS) activity of the mononuclear cells before, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after pentostatin administration. In patients with HCL the median level of intracellular 2,5OAS increased 4.6-fold at 4 h and 11.5-fold at 24 h compared to the pretreatment value. Among the other seven patients, the median intracellular 2,5OAS remained unchanged in three patients and rose slightly by 2 to 14 times in four patients. Eleven patients (eight with HCL and two with BCL) responded to pentostatin. The median increase in 2,5OAS among the responders was 13.0-fold (range 4.8-30.0) whereas that among non-responders was 2.2-fold (range 0.2-6.3). The difference was highly significant (p less than 0.0001). In five of the total seventeen patients, the plasma levels of 2,5OAS activity were also determined and changes in plasma levels paralleled those measured intracellularly. To determine if the elevation of 2,5OAS is mediated by induction of interferon alpha, the expressions of mRNA for interferon alpha and beta were investigated by means of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction using the corresponding sense primers. In none of the five patients thus studied could we find an induction of mRNA for interferon alpha or beta in the leukemic cells during treatment with pentostatin. Thus, response to pentostatin correlates with induction of 2,5OAS directly and the 2',5'-oligoadenylate system seems to be involved in cytotoxicity."
True,case report highlights rare adverse drug reaction oral roxithromycin causing toxic epidermal necrolysis ten nan,22777150,roxithromycin,adverse drug reaction/TEN/toxic epidermal necrolysis,"This case report highlights a very rare adverse drug reaction of oral roxithromycin causing toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). A 54-year-old male patient diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection was prescribed oral roxithromycin 150 mg twice daily for 7 days. On the 10th day, the patient was admitted to the emergency with sore throat, redness, watering of eyes, painful micturition, and severe skin lesions. The skin lesions were multiple, severely painful, burning, coalesced, and filled with fluid-producing large blisters appearing on the lip, face, and trunk and then gradually spreading to legs, arms, palms, hands, and feet extensively involving much >30% of body surface area. Clinical examination, blood investigation, and histopathological examination of the skin confirmed the diagnosis of TEN. There was no history of any concomitant medications, drug allergy, burn injury, recent graft, or transplant or any coexisting infections such as herpes simplex. Other resembling skin diseases were eliminated after proper dermatological examination. This episode of TEN was probably drug (roxithromycin) induced. The drug was immediately stopped, and the patient was treated meticulously resulting in gradual reversal of the diseased state. Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale suggested the likelihood that oral administration of roxithromycin was responsible for the TEN was 'probable.'"
False,frequent strategies included dietary changes vitamins modification routines rest exercise prescribed medications anemia vitamin deficiency testosterone deficiencynan,15186711,testosterone,anemia,"Fatigue, a common symptom among persons living with HIV/AIDS, is often underreported and undertreated. However, given fatigue's pervasive effects on well-being and functioning, the identification of its physiologic and psychological causes and strategies to alleviate it are important to patients' quality of life. As part of a study to understand better how HIV-positive middle-aged and older adults (50+) manage common symptoms, 49 participants discussed in depth their experience with fatigue. Most engaged in both self-care activities and sought the assistance of a health care professional. Frequent strategies included dietary changes, vitamins, modification of routines, rest, exercise, and prescribed medications for anemia, Vitamin B(12) deficiency, or testosterone deficiency. Complementary and alternative medicine (e.g., acupuncture, massage, herbal remedies, special juices) was also commonly used. Participants often used multiple strategies to alleviate their fatigue, possibly because of their tendency to attribute it to multiple causes. These HIV-positive older adults were also apt to view fatigue as an indirect indicator of their overall health status and immune functioning. This may explain why many of the coping strategies they used could be considered approaches to improving their overall health status as a means to increasing their energy levels. Health care professionals can play an important role in helping HIV-positive individuals manage their fatigue. The majority of participants tried to implement the coping suggestions offered by health care professionals, as well as those from family, friends, and support group members."
True,addition confirmed clinical evidence administration ascorbic acid lessens morbidity mortality systemic chromium poisoning nan,10382555,chromium,poisoning,"Repeated topical exposure to chromium(VI) may cause an allergic contact dermatitis or the formation of chrome ulcers. Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III)."
True,fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged apnoea lasting several hours succinylcholine treated new preparation human serum cholinesterasenan,871943,succinylcholine,apnoea,Fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged apnoea lasting several hours after succinylcholine have been treated by a new preparation of human serum cholinesterase. Adequate spontaneous respiration was re-established in an average period of ten minutes after the injection. In 12 patients biochemical genetic examinations confirmed the presence of an atypical serum cholinesterase. In three patients none of the usual variants were found. It is therefore supposed that other unknown variants of serum cholinesterase exist which cannot hydrolyze succinylcholine. The use of serum cholinesterase in succinylcholine apnoea provided considerable relief to both patient and anaesthetist.

False,arsenic trioxide aso highly efficacious acute promyelocytic leukemia apl nan,16968895,Arsenic trioxide,APL/acute promyelocytic leukemia,"Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is highly efficacious in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Aquaglyceroporin 9 (AQP9) is a transmembrane protein that may be involved in arsenic uptake. In 10 of 11 myeloid and lymphoid leukemia lines, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and Western blotting showed that AQP9 expression correlated positively with As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. As a proof-of-principle, transfection of EGFP-tagged AQP9 to the hepatoma line Hep3B, not expressing AQP9 and As2O3 insensitive, led to membrane AQP9 expression and increased As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. Similarly, the chronic myeloid leukemia line K562 expressed low levels of AQP9 and was As2O3 insensitive. The K562(EGFP-AQP9) transfectant accumulated significantly higher levels of intracellular arsenic than control K562(EGFP) when incubated with As2O3, resulting in significantly increased As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of the myeloid leukemia line HL-60 with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) up-regulated AQP9, leading to a significantly increased arsenic uptake and As2O3-induced cytotoxicity on incubation with As2O3, which might explain the synergism between ATRA and As2O3. Therefore, AQP9 controlled arsenic transport and might determine As2O3 sensitivity. Q-PCR showed that primary APL cells expressed AQP9 significantly (2-3 logs) higher than other acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), which might explain their exquisite As2O3 sensitivity. However, APL and AML with maturation expressed comparable AQP9 levels, suggesting that AQP9 expression was related to granulocytic maturation."

(2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."

Recently, vigabatrin-induced visual field constriction (VFC) and abnormal ocular electrophysiological studies were reported. In this study, we assessed visual fields, visual evoked potentials (VEPs), and electroretinography (ERG) in children treated with vigabatrin. Twenty-four visually asymptomatic children underwent a clinical ophthalmological examination, perimetry when appropriate, and VEP and ERG. Thirteen patients had at least one abnormal study. VFC was seen in 11 of 17 patients who had perimetry; 5 of 15 patients who underwent VEP testing and 4 of 11 who underwent ERG testing had abnormal examinations. For the most part, abnormal VEPs and ERGs were found in children who also had VFC. There was a consistent trend for longer treatment periods to correlate with VFC, abnormal ERGs, and VEPs. In summary, over half of the children treated with vigabatrin demonstrated VFC or abnormal ocular electrophysiological studies. Perimetry seemed to be the most sensitive modality for identifying vigabatrin toxicity. Abnormal ERGs and VEPs were primarily seen in children with VFC and may be useful in monitoring children who are not appropriate candidates for perimetry. Although the incidence of vigabatrin-induced VFC is worrisome, in the context of intractable seizures or infantile spasms, therapeutic benefits must be weighed against risks."

Upper GI symptoms in low dose ASA users are common but often careless or misinterpreted and they are not always related to the presence of mucosal injury. Usually, low dose ASA related ulcers are reasonably small and asymptomatic, and probably heal over a period of weeks to a few months. But, the real clinical problem occurs when the ulcer results in a GI complication (mostly bleeding). The estimated average excess risk of symptomatic or complicated ulcer related to low dose ASA is five cases per 1000 ASA users per year. Death is the worst outcome of GI complications in low dose ASA users, but data about this aspect are scarce. Current evidence indicates that low dose ASA can damage the lower GI tract also, but the real size of the problem is still unknown."
True,however iontophoresis noradrenaline thermal hyperalgesia greater guanethidine pretreated site saline pretreated sitenan,11474550,guanethidine,thermal hyperalgesia,"Supersensitivity to noradrenaline contributes to certain vascular disorders (e.g., hypertension) and chronic neuropathic pain conditions (e.g., complex regional pain syndrome). We aimed to develop a procedure for inducing adrenergic supersensitivity that could be used to investigate the role of catecholamines in these clinical conditions. In the first study, three doses of guanethidine were administered by iontophoresis to separate small patches of skin in the forearm of healthy human volunteers. Four to five hours later. the vasoconstrictor response to the adrenergic releasing agent tyramine was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by iontophoretic pretreatment with guanethidine, indicating that guanethidine had depleted endogenous adrenergic stores. In a second study, guanethidine and saline were administered by iontophoresis four times over approximately 2 weeks at separate sites in the forearm. One to two days after the final pretreatment, vasoconstriction to the iontophoresis of a weak dose of noradrenaline was enhanced at sites pretreated with guanethidine. To investigate the effect of guanethidine pretreatment on thermal hyperalgesia. the experimental sites were sensitized to heat by the topical application of 0.6% capsaicin. Both before and after the application of capsaicin, the heat-pain threshold and heat-pain ratings to suprathreshold stimulation were similar at sites pretreated for 2 weeks with guanethidine or saline. However, after the iontophoresis of noradrenaline, thermal hyperalgesia was greater at the guanethidine-pretreated site than the saline pretreated site. These observations indicate that prolonged depletion of adrenergic stores by guanethidine induces adrenergic supersensitivity in cutaneous vessels, and that adrenergic supersensitivity enhances thermal hyperalgesia in the presence of noradrenaline."

Although the presumed drug doses needed for an efficient ER stress reaction and ensuing apoptosis in cancer cells is somewhat higher than those prescribed for HIV-infected persons, nelfinavir represents one of the few clinically applicable ER stress-inducing agents, and is currently being tested in clinical studies on cancer patients. Therefore, this chapter describes how to obtain and use nelfinavir for in vitro and in vivo studies. In addition, methods are described that might facilitate the analysis and monitoring of the nelfinavir-induced ER stress response either in cancer cells in cell culture or in cancer tissue biopsies. These methods include various fluorescence-based ER staining techniques and the expression analysis of primary and secondary ER stress markers by immunoblotting and RT-PCR analysis. Among the several methods presented, the analysis of an unconventional XBP1 splicing, caused by the ER stress sensor IRE1, is shown to present the most sensitive and most specific marker for nelfinavir-induced ER stress. Primers and PCR conditions suitable for XBP1 PCR and splicing analysis are presented. Such a PCR-based XBP1 splicing analysis might not only be suitable to monitor nelfinavir-induced ER stress, but could also be applied in drug screening programs to test for other ER stress-inducing agents with similar activities or synergistic activities with nelfinavir."

Here, we report the favourable outcome in 81 paediatric APL patients treated according to the consecutive acute myeloid leukaemia-Berlin/Frankfurt/Muenster (AML-BFM) trials -93/-98/-2004 with an anthracycline-cytarabine regimen in combination with all-trans-retinoid acid (ATRA). Outcomes achieved by treatment with a reduced cumulative anthracycline dose (350 mg/m(2)) were comparable to those reported for studies with higher doses. Five-year overall survival of the total cohort was 89 +/- 4% and event-free survival (pEFS) was 73 +/- 6%. Overall survival was similar when comparing AML-BFM trial periods (trial 93: 88 +/- 8%, 98: 85 +/- 7% and 2004: 94 +/- 8%, P((logrank)) = 0.63). Seventy-five (93%) patients achieved complete remission. Most fatal events occurred during the first 6 weeks of treatment. Long-term cardiotoxicity was observed in one patient. Two patients suffered from secondary haematological malignancies. Salvage treatment was effective in 7/9 patients (78%) with relapsed APL, who now are long-term survivors after second line combination treatment with arsenic trioxide (4/7 patients) and stem cell transplantation (5/7 patients). Our results demonstrate that - combined with ATRA - a lower cumulative anthracycline dose can be used safely to maintain high cure rates and promote the reduction of long-term sequelae, such as cardiotoxicity in APL patients."

The hypoxia-activated pro-drug TH-302 may have selective toxicity for hypoxic and neighboring cells in tumors. Here we characterize the spatial distribution and ability of TH-302 to selectively target hypoxic regions and complement the effect of doxorubicin and docetaxel by modifying biomarker distribution. Athymic nude mice bearing human breast MCF-7 or prostate PC-3 tumors were treated with doxorubicin or docetaxel respectively and TH-302 alone or in combination. Biomarkers of drug effect including γH2aX (a marker of DNA damage), cleaved caspase-3 or -6 (markers of apoptosis) and reduction in Ki-67 (a marker of cell proliferation) were quantified in tumor sections in relation to functional blood vessels (recognized by DiOC7) and hypoxia (recognized by EF5) using immunohistochemistry. γH2aX expression at 10 min and cleaved caspase-3 or -6 at 24 hr after doxorubicin or docetaxel decreased with increasing distance from tumor blood vessels, with minimal expression in hypoxic regions; maximum reduction in Ki67 levels was observed in regions closest to vasculature at 24 hr. TH-302 induced maximal cell damage in hypoxic and neighboring regions, but was also active in tumor regions closer to blood vessels. TH-302 given 4 hr before doxorubicin or docetaxel increased DNA damage and apoptosis throughout the tumor compared to chemotherapy alone. When given with doxorubicin or docetaxel, TH-302 complements and enhances anticancer effects in both perivascular and hypoxic regions but also increases toxicity."

The serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, and d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist. In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT6 gene (HTR6) with METH-induced psychosis."
True,increased splenic iron content erythrocyte injury observed treatment low dose cisplatin nan,20540689,cisplatin,splenic,"Cisplatin is one of the commonly-used chemotherapeutic drugs to efficiently treat malignant tumors in clinic, however, the adverse effects of cisplatin such as nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and hemolytic uremic syndrome are often observed at its clinical doses (approximately 60 mg/m(2)), which limit its broader application. In earlier studies, little attention was paid to the subtle changes in the architecture of lymphatic organs after low doses of cisplatin treatment. This paper reviews current understanding of cisplatin-induced erythrocyte injury, and presents our latest finding that a low dose of cisplatin (3.6 mg/m(2)/day, 14 days) could induce specific hemosiderin deposition in spleen of both normal and hepatoma-22 (H22) inoculated Balb/C mice. This dose of cisplatin significantly inhibited H22-induced acute ascites development. No significant toxicity was induced by this dose of cisplatin to tissues except for hemosiderin accumulation in the spleen of both normal and H22 tumor-bearing mice. Increased splenic iron content and erythrocyte injury were observed after treatment with the low dose of cisplatin. The mRNA levels of ferroportin (FPN1) and ferritin were upregulated by 25 and 5-fold in spleen, respectively. Overexpression of FPN1 and ferritin protein were also been observed at protein levels by Western blotting analysis. In addition, the mRNA expression of hepcidin was also increased, suggesting blockage of iron recycling through FPN1 in spleen with cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, cisplatin treatment damages the erythrocytes which accumulate in the red pulp of spleen with defective recycling of FPN1 and ferritin protein. Hepcidin inhibits the function of FPN1 as iron-exporter leading to iron overloaded inside ferritins of splenic cells, which are stained with abnormal hemosiderin accumulation. These results demonstrate that cisplatin-caused hemosiderin deposition in spleen provides a valuable clue for understanding the molecular basis of toxicity of cisplatin and hemosiderin accumulation and iron metabolism in vivo."

Treatment with MTX often causes toxicity, which can necessitate dose reduction or treatment cessation. Interindividual differences in adverse reactions can be due to different factors, including polymorphisms in key genes. Recently, we confirmed the association between SLCO1B1 rs11045879 polymorphism and toxicity previously proposed by Treviño and colleagues. As SLCO1B1 is a transporter involved in MTX elimination, other polymorphisms in genes from this pathway could also have a role in MTX toxicity. The aim of the present study was to analyze in depth the role of polymorphisms in the genes of the MTX transport pathway as putative toxicity predictors in pediatric ALL."

Under normal physiologic conditions, the rate and magnitude of oxidant formation is balanced by the rate of oxidant elimination. However, an imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants results in oxidative stress, which is the pathogenic outcome of the overproduction of oxidants that overwhelms the cellular antioxidant capacity. There is growing evidence that increased oxidative stress and associated oxidative damage are mediators of vascular injury in cardiovascular pathologies, including hypertension, atherosclerosis and ischemia-reperfusion. This development has evoked considerable interest because of the possibilities that therapies targeted against reactive oxygen intermediates by decreasing the generation of reactive oxygen species and/or by increasing availability of antioxidants may be useful in minimizing vascular injury. This review focuses on the vascular actions of reactive oxygen species, the role of oxidative stress in vascular damage in hypertension and the therapeutic potential of modulating oxygen radical bioavailability in hypertension. In particular, the following topics will be highlighted: chemistry and sources of reactive oxygen species, antioxidant defense mechanisms, signaling events mediated by reactive oxygen species, role of reactive oxygen species in hypertension and the putative therapeutic role of antioxidants in cardiovascular disease."

Pomalidomide therapy is effective for alleviating anemia in myelofibrosis; we examined the relationship between plasma cytokine/chemokine levels and response to treatment with pomalidomide. The study population included 32 Mayo Clinic patients (median age 66 years) who participated in two consecutive clinical trials of pomalidomide therapy for myelofibrosis-associated anemia. Ten (31%) patients achieved anemia response per International Working Group criteria. Anemia response was seen only in the presence of JAK2V617F (P = 0.04) and, in addition, predicted by lower circulating levels of MCP-1 (P = 0.003), IL-2R (P = 0.008), IL-15 (0.01), and IL-8 (P = 0.02). Marked splenomegaly and increased serum LDH level were associated with poor response (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively) and with each other (P = 0.02), but not with JAK2V617F. The aforementioned cytokines were not significantly associated with JAK2V617F but increased levels of sIL-2R (P = 0.01), IL-15 (P = 0.06), and MCP-1 (P = 0.07) clustered with marked splenomegaly. Current data suggest that, in the context of pomalidomide treatment, response is more likely in the presence of JAK2V617F and further predicted by the absence of marked splenomegaly or increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines."

Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."
False,molecular mechanisms apigenin induced cellcycle arrest apoptosis hormone refractory human prostate carcinoma du cellsnan,14750216,apigenin,prostate carcinoma,"Development of effective agents for treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer has become a national medical priority. We have reported recently that apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone), found in many common fruits and vegetables, has shown remarkable effects in inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis in many human prostate carcinoma cells. Here we demonstrate the molecular mechanism of inhibitory action of apigenin on androgen-refractory human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells that have mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 and pRb. Treatment of cells with apigenin resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of growth, colony formation, and G1 phase arrest of the cell cycle. This effect was associated with a marked decrease in the protein expression of cyclin D1, D2, and E and their activating partner, cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)2, 4, and 6, with concomitant upregulation of WAF1/p21, KIP1/p27, INK4a/p16, and INK4c/p18. The induction of WAF1/p21 and its growth inhibitory effects by apigenin appears to be independent of p53 and pRb status of these cells. Apigenin treatment also resulted in alteration in Bax/Bcl2 ratio in favor of apoptosis, which was associated with the release of cytochrome c and induction of apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1). This effect was found to result in a significant increase in cleaved fragments of caspase-9, -3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Further, apigenin treatment resulted in downmodulation of the constitutive expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)/p65 and NF-kappaB/p50 in the nuclear fraction that correlated with an increase in the expression of IkappaB-alpha (IkappaBalpha) in the cytosol. Taken together, we concluded that molecular mechanisms during apigenin-mediated growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in DU145 cells was due to (1) modulation in cell-cycle machinery, (2) disruption of mitochondrial function, and (3) NF-kappaB inhibition."

Acetaminophen-poisoned cats develop methemoglobinemia and sometimes hepatic failure. To determine the benefit of using methylene blue, a treatment for methemoglobinemia, along with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the recommended treatment for acetaminophen-poisoned cats, groups of 3 male and 3 female cats each were given methylene blue NAC, or both after administration of acetaminophen (120 mg/kg of body weight, PO). Male cats seemed more susceptible than female cats to acetaminophen toxicosis, because 3 males died of hepatic failure (2 cats given acetaminophen/methylene blue and 1 given acetaminophen/NAC/methylene blue). Although NAC alone seemed to elicit the best overall response, methylene blue, alone or in combination with NAC, may be useful in female cats."

On the basis of this interaction with both endogenous and synthetic substances, glutathione and the key enzyme for its conjugation, glutathione S-transferase, appear to be critical determinants in tumor cell resistance to several antineoplastic drugs, e.g. platinum analogs. In ten established head and neck cancer cell lines (UM-SCC 10A, 10B, 11B, 14A, 14B, 14C, and 22B, HLac79, 8029NA, and 8029DDP4) chemosensitivity to cisplatin, carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and bleomycin, as well as cellular glutathione content and activity of glutathione S-transferase were determined. The results revealed no correlation between the sensitivity of tumor cells to any of the drugs tested and the level of glutathione or the activity of glutathione S-transferase. However, the cisplatin-resistant subpopulation 8029DDP4 showed the highest glutathione level and marked cross-resistance to bleomycin. Glutathione depletion with buthionine sulfoximine led to moderately increased sensitivity towards cisplatin and carboplatin in all cell lines, but did not affect their response to 5-fluorouracil or bleomycin. These results suggest that the level of glutathione or the activity of glutathione S-transferase is not a suitable parameter for the assessment of chemosensitivity in head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma lines. However, response to platinum analogs is influenced by alterations of the initial intracellular glutathione concentration."

False,findings confirm importance rhoprock signaling pathway intrahepatic metastasis human hcc indicate y-27632 may useful prevention intrahepatic metastasis human hccnan,11230737,Y-27632,metastasis,"Intrahepatic metastasis is one of the most important prognostic factors for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cell motility mediated by Rho- and p160 Rho-associated coiledcoil forming protein kinase (p160ROCK) signaling pathways has recently been shown to play a critical role in intrahepatic metastasis in human HCC. Furthermore, the stable introduction of dominant-negative p160ROCK into Li7 cells resulted in a reduced metastatic rate in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). To investigate whether the specific p160ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, could also inhibit intrahepatic metastasis, the effect of Y-27632 on the cell motility and intrahepatic metastasis of Li7 was investigated. Y-27632 markedly blocked actin reorganization and motility of Li7 cells mediated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Y-27632 was administered continuously into the peritoneal cavity using a micro-osmotic pump, together with orthotopic implantation of Li7 cells into the liver of SCID mice. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone was administered as the control. The incidence of mice with metastatic nodules decreased in the Y-27632-treated group. The primary tumor volume at the site of injection was smaller in the Y-27632-treated group compared with the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Histologically, control tumors showed infiltrative growth into the sinusoidal area at the tumor boundary, whereas Y-27632-treated tumors showed expansive growth and low invasiveness. These findings confirm the importance of the Rho/p160ROCK signaling pathway in intrahepatic metastasis of human HCC, and indicate that Y-27632 may be useful for the prevention of intrahepatic metastasis of human HCC."

Thereby, a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted. Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take BPT/CLZ in the following schedule; BPT: 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t.i.d. from day 7 to 14, CLZ: 200 mg t.i.d. from day 3 to 14. At various time intervals, physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo platelet aggregation and determination of intraplatelet cAMP were performed. Throughout the observation period, no significant alteration in vital signs was observed. Seven out of 12 subjects experienced headache of a short duration accompanying facial flush in one and nausea in one, especially after ingestion of CLZ. All of these symptoms, probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents, were of mild degree and no special treatment was required. Intraplatelet cAMP content was gradually but significantly increased to 9.84 +/- 4.59 pmol per 10(9) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value (6.87 +/- 2.25 pmol). The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted. In conclusion, the combined administration of BPT/CLZ is safe at doses used in the study, though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated."

On the 10th day, the patient was admitted to the emergency with sore throat, redness, watering of eyes, painful micturition, and severe skin lesions. The skin lesions were multiple, severely painful, burning, coalesced, and filled with fluid-producing large blisters appearing on the lip, face, and trunk and then gradually spreading to legs, arms, palms, hands, and feet extensively involving much >30% of body surface area. Clinical examination, blood investigation, and histopathological examination of the skin confirmed the diagnosis of TEN. There was no history of any concomitant medications, drug allergy, burn injury, recent graft, or transplant or any coexisting infections such as herpes simplex. Other resembling skin diseases were eliminated after proper dermatological examination. This episode of TEN was probably drug (roxithromycin) induced. The drug was immediately stopped, and the patient was treated meticulously resulting in gradual reversal of the diseased state. Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale suggested the likelihood that oral administration of roxithromycin was responsible for the TEN was 'probable.'"

True,past years enduring explanation schizophrenia dopamine hypothesis proposes dopaminergic system overactive widespread diseasenan,9278187,dopamine,schizophrenia,"For the past 20 years the most enduring explanation for schizophrenia has been the dopamine hypothesis, which proposes that the dopaminergic system is overactive in this widespread disease. Classically, the D2 receptor formed the core of the dopamine hypothesis since there was considerable evidence for elevations of D2 receptor levels in the brains of schizophrenic patients, and because these receptors served as the primary target in mediating antipsychotic effects of most neuroleptics. However, the dopamine D4 receptor has recently received particular attention in this context. This is because the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, which is effective in treating refractory schizophrenics without the side-effect profile of typical neuroleptics, displays a 10-fold higher affinity for D4 compared to D2 or D3 receptors. Furthermore, the concentration in plasma water of clinical doses ofclozapine correlates well with its in vitro binding affinity for D4, but not D2 or D3 receptors, suggesting that D4 is a potential target in mediating clozapine's antipsychotic effects. As well, marked elevations in the level of a D4-like site (not identical to the D4 receptor) has been seen in the striatum of postmortem schizophrenic brains, but not in control brains. Finally, the most interesting feature of the D4 receptor is perhaps the array of polymorphisms associated with it, creating structural diversity in this receptor that supercedes all other known catecholamine receptors. The existence of these D4 polymorphisms raises the possibility that structural variations of this receptor may be associated with an increased susceptibility to schizophrenia, or observed variations in individual response to clozapine treatment. However, several studies aimed at investigating these hypotheses could not establish a direct role of D4 in schizophrenia. Furthermore, no association was evident between the polymorphic forms of D4 and susceptibility to schizophrenia, or variable clozapine response. Nevertheless, investigations surrounding this receptor has been far from futile. The observations which support the idea that D4 might serve as a target for clozapine have significantly modified and extended our understanding of mechanisms underlying atypical antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia, as well as the dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia. Further characterization of this receptor may prove to be crucial in designing highly effective antipsychotic drugs with minimal contraindications."
False,keratitis isolates susceptibility differences among five fluoroquinolones nan,12967804,fluoroquinolones,keratitis,We compared the in vitro susceptibility patterns and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of gatifloxacin (GAT) and moxifloxacin (MOX) (fourth-generation fluoroquinolones) to ciprofloxacin (CIP) and ofloxacin (OFX) (second-generation fluoroquinolones) and levofloxacin (LEV; third-generation fluoroquinolone) using bacterial keratitis isolates. The goal was to determine whether the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones offer any advantages over the second- and third-generation fluoroquinolones.

Also, it is unclear whether various types of alcoholic beverages may have a different impact on risk."
True,ximelagatran oral direct thrombin inhibitor found efficient vitamin antagonist drugs prevention embolic events recently withdrawn abnormal liver function testsnan,17020434,Ximelagatran,abnormal liver function,"Atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62%, and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22%. Overall, in high-risk patients, warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes, with a relative risk reduction of 36%. Ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was found to be as efficient as vitamin K antagonist drugs in the prevention of embolic events, but has been recently withdrawn because of abnormal liver function tests. The ACTIVE-W (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) in the prevention af embolic events. Idraparinux, a Factor Xa inhibitor, is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor-blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac remodelling. Preliminary studies suggest that statins could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion. Finally, percutaneous methods for the exclusion of left atrial appendage are under investigation in high-risk patients."
True,adhesion lung metastasis human melanoma cells nodscid mice also potentiated cotreatment 12(s)-hete nan,23664097,12(S)-HETE,melanoma,"12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) is a non-haeme iron-containing dioxygenase that forms 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) or 15(S)-HETE. Several biological mediators including cytokines, growth factors and lipid metabolites released during tumour cell-endothelial cell adhesion are associated with malignant tumour progression. Here we found that HETEs released from the host organ played a critical role in tumour metastasis. Intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma cells caused lung nodule formation, which was markedly attenuated in 12/15-LOX null mice. Co-injection of melanoma cells with 12(S)-HETE increased the lung homing activity of B16F10 melanoma cells. In vitro studies showed that 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent increase of adhesion of B16F10 cells on collagen or fibronectin. The melanoma cell adhesion was then evaluated in pulmonary primary cell culture isolated from wild-type (WT) and 12/15-LOX knockout (KO) mice. It was found that the adhesion of melanoma cells on the epithelial cells isolated from 12/15-LOX null mice was reduced in comparison with those isolated from WT mice. Treatment of 12(S)-HETE increased the pFAK in melanoma cells adhering on collagen-coated slide. The enhancement of adherence elicited by 12(S)-HETE in B16F10 cells could be antagonised by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor 14 (FAK inhibitor) or PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor). 12(S)-HETE increased the phosphorylation of FAK and ERK in adhering melanoma cells. The FAK phosphorylation induced by 12(S)-HETE was further inhibited by PD98059, indicating that FAK is the downstream target of ERK. The adhesion and lung metastasis of human melanoma cells of C32 in NOD/SCID mice were also potentiated by co-treatment with 12(S)-HETE. These results demonstrate that 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE activates ERK and FAK signalling pathways, thereby upregulates the adhesion and metastatic potential of melanoma cells. The endogenous release of 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE in the host organ may affect the metastatic potential of melanoma. "
True,nickel dermatitis nan,2406062,Nickel,dermatitis,"Several reports indicate that the prevalence of nickel sensitivity among females in the general population is around 10 per cent and probably is increasing, especially in schoolchildren. It has been claimed that there is such a high correlation between a positive history of nickel hypersensitivity and patch-test results that testing is unnecessary if there is a history of hypersensitivity. This is not true. Nickel hypersensitivity itself is not a serious health problem for the individual. However, when hand eczema also is present, the situation is quite different. Concerns about medical metal implants in nickel-sensitive persons appear to have been exaggerated, and nickel intake in food probably is not a serious difficulty, although some persons may be unusually sensitive. In dealing with the clinical problems of nickel dermatitis, we must not overlook prophylaxis. It seems important to introduce safe methods of ear piercing (a primary source of nickel hypersensitivity) and to spread information about the health hazard potential of the seemingly harmless sensitivity to nickel."
True,hemobiology vascular disease review potential gliclazide influence pathogenesis diabetic vascular disease nan,7833498,gliclazide,diabetic vascular disease,"Patients with type II diabetes commonly die from thrombotic vascular disease. Large vessel occlusion due to thrombosis or atherosclerotic stenosis is a process accelerated by diabetes and results in premature death. Diabetic small vessel disease, with its unique microangiopathic process, underlies many of the large vessel changes as well as causing retinopathy and nephropathy. The microangiopathic changes produce a prothrombotic tendency that has been widely reported in type II diabetes. There is reduced endothelial cell production of prostacyclin and the activators of fibrinolysis, together with increased platelet reactivity. In addition, there is increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress due to excess free-radical activity and impaired antioxidant defenses particularly in the presence of microvascular disease. The development of many of these abnormalities is associated with poor long-term glycemic control. However, the changes are also seen in atherosclerosis in nondiabetic patients where the progression of the disease can be modified by antiplatelet agents and antioxidants. The process of vascular damage is accelerated by diabetes, often due to co-existing disease and aging, although it is not clear that improvement in long-term glycemic control by lowering blood glucose levels to near to the nondiabetic state reduces the development of small and large vessel disease. Although the biochemical mechanism underlying this observation remains uncertain, protein glycosylation and increased platelet reactivity are implicated and interrelated. Increased oxidative stress due to excess free-radical activity may be central to diabetic vascular disease as endothelial cell damage, lipoprotein oxidation, modification of both platelet reactivity and arachidonic acid cascade are all properties of free radicals and their reaction products lipid peroxides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

True,current study investigated whether physiological intervention feeding high fat diet hfd induces obesity male spraguedawley rats sensitizes doxorubicininduced cardiotoxicitynan,18674790,fat,obesity,"Often, chemotherapy by doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is limited due to life threatening cardiotoxicity in patients during and posttherapy. Recently, we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and triglycerides and increased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation, ATP synthesis, and upregulated JAK/STAT3 pathway. In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high fat diet (HFD), which induces obesity in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. A LD(10) dose (8 mg doxorubicin/kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher cardiotoxicity, cardiac dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in the obese (OB) rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity. Doxorubicin toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol (toxic metabolite) in the normal diet-fed (ND) and OB hearts. Mechanistic studies revealed that OB rats are sensitized due to: (1) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, (2) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, (3) decreased plasma adiponectin levels, (4) decreased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation (666.9+/-14.0 nmol/min/g heart in ND versus 400.2+/-11.8 nmol/min/g heart in OB), (5) decreased mitochondrial AMP-alpha2 protein kinase, and (6) 86% drop in cardiac ATP levels accompanied by decreased ATP/ADP ratio after doxorubicin administration. Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK/STAT3 pathway. In conclusion, HFD-induced obese rats are highly sensitized to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial ATP generation, increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the JAK/STAT3 pathway."
True,incidence renal stones among cadmium exposed battery workersnan,8343420,cadmium,renal stones,"The health effects of occupational exposure to cadmium were studied in a group of 902 workers employed for at least one year in a Swedish battery factory between 1931 and 1982. Data on air cadmium concentrations for different periods were combined with company employment records to obtain individual cumulative exposure estimates. A questionnaire including questions on the occurrence of kidney stones was sent to all 601 living workers and to the next of kin of 267 of the deceased workers. The response rate was 88%. 73 workers reported renal calculi that appeared after initial employment. A dose-response relation was found between cumulative exposure to cadmium and age standardised cumulative incidence. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were then computed for three exposure categories (< 250, 250- < 5000, and 5000 micrograms/m3 x years) standardised for calendar time, age, and smoking with the low exposure group as reference level. The IRRs were 1.0, 1.6 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.7-3.4], and 3.0 (95% CI 1.3-6.8) respectively. beta 2 Microglobulin measurements were available for 33 workers who formed stones; 13 of these workers had tubular proteinuria (beta 2 microglobulin > or = 34 micrograms/mmole creatinine)--that is, a prevalence of 39%. There was also an indication of a steeper dose-response relation among workers with tubular proteinuria."

True,presence methane lactulose breath testing associated constipation predominant ibsnan,17713456,methane,constipation,"An overlap of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) exists across subtype groups. Symptoms include intestinal gas, diarrhea, dyspepsia, bloating, abdominal pain, and constipation. The unifying symptom may be excessive intestinal gas as a by-product of intestinal microbial fermentation. Abnormal fermentation of food takes place when gut microbes expand proximally into the small intestine instead of being confined predominantly to the colon. Such proximal expansion of indigenous gut microbes or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may lead to activation of host mucosal immunity and an increase in intestinal permeability to result in flu-like extra-intestinal symptoms that accompany the classic IBS symptoms of altered bowels. The presence of methane on lactulose breath testing is associated with constipation-predominant IBS. Antibiotic therapy may be appropriate to treat underlying SIBO in IBS patients. Seventy-five percent improvement of IBS symptoms was reported in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study once antibiotics succeeded in treating bacterial overgrowth. Once a good clinical response and normalization of the lactulose breath test are achieved, a prokinetic agent may be used to stimulate phase III of interdigestive motility to delay relapse of bacterial overgrowth."

Eleven homosexual men with advanced Kaposi's sarcoma were entered in the trial. Changes in size, colour and associated oedema of selected 'target' lesions were measured. Clinical, biochemical and haematological toxicities were assessed. Ten subjects were evaluated. A partial response was achieved in four, of whom two subsequently relapsed. Stabilization of Kaposi's sarcoma occurred in the remaining six, maintained until the end of the trial period in four. The drug was generally well tolerated, with few mild symptoms of toxicity. The main problem encountered was haematological toxicity, with three subjects experiencing severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5 x 10(9)/l). There was no evidence of cardiotoxicity. In this small patient sample, liposomal daunorubicin was an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma."
False,atra alltrans retinoic acid dimethylsulfoxide dmso induce differentiation hl nb two human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines myelocytic lineage upregulated two enzymes various degrees  treatmentnan,21720768,ATRA/all-trans retinoic acid,acute myeloid leukemia,"The expressions of β1,3-N-acetylglucosamonyltransferase-2 and -8 (β3GnT-2, β3GnT-8),-the two main glycosyltransferases responsible for the synthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine (polyLacNAc) in glycans, and β3GnT-5 participating in the syntheses of sphingoglycolipids were studied in leukemia cell lines during differentiation using RT-PCR method. β3GnT-2 and β3GnT-8 distribute widely in six myeloid and monocytoid leukemia cell lines with different abundances, while β3GnT-4 was only present in NB4 cells. ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which induce the differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 (two human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines) to myelocytic lineage, up-regulated these two enzymes with various degrees at 2 and 72 h of treatment. In HL-60 cells treated with ATRA, the increase of β3GnT-8 was more than β3GnT-2, while in NB4 cells treated with DMSO, the increase of β3GnT-2 was more than β3GnT-8. However, when HL-60 and NB4 were differentiated to monocytic lineage induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate the expressions of β3GnT-2 and β3GnT-8 showed no alterations or the increase of expressions was far less than those in myelocytic differentiation. By means of FITC-labeled tomato lectin affinity staining and flow-cytometry, it was found that the product of β3GnT-2 and -8, polyLacNAc was also increased on the cell surface of HL-60 and NB4 treated with ATRA or DMSO, but unchanged when treated with PMA. These results were in accordance with the up-regulation of the mRNAs of β3GnT-2 and -8. The expression of β3GnT-5, however, was not changed both in myelocytic and monocytic differentiations. The difference in the up-regulation of β3GnT-2 and -8, especially their products may become a useful index to discriminate the myelocytic and monocytic differentiation of leukemia cells."

False,daidzein activates choline acetyltransferase mcixc cells improves druginduced amnesia nan,16428827,choline,amnesia,"The choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activator, which enhances cholinergic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of acetylcholine (ACh), is an important factor in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect (46%) on ChAT in vitro. Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana, the active component was ultimately identified as daidzein (4',7-dihydroxy-isoflavone). In order to investigate the effects of daidzein from Pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine-induced impairments of learning and memory, we conducted a series of in vivo tests. Administration of daidzein (4.5 mg/kg body weight) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia, according to the results of a Y-maze test. Injections of scopolamine into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y-maze tests (a 37% decreases in alternation behavior). By way of contrast, mice treated with daidzein prior to the scopolamine injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment (an approximately 12%-21% decrease in alternation behavior). These results indicate that daidzein might play a role in acetylcholine biosynthesis as a ChAT activator, and that it also ameliorates scopolamine-induced amnesia."

Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg paroxetine and 1.2 mg alprazolam. On the 10th day of paroxetine and alprazolam treatment, the patient exhibited marked psychomotor retardation, disorientation, and severe muscle rigidity with tremors. The patient had a fever (38.2 degrees C), fluctuating blood pressure (between 165/90 and 130/70 mg mm Hg), and severe extrapyramidal symptoms. Laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatine phosphokinase (2218 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (134 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (78 IU/L), and BUN (27.9 mg/ml) levels. The patient received bromocriptine and diazepam to treat his symptoms. 7 days later, the fever disappeared and the patient's serum CPK levels were normalized (175 IU/L). This patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), thus demonstrating that NMS-like symptoms can occur after combined paroxetine and alprazolam treatment. The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case, indicating a probable relationship between the patient's NMS-like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case. The involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected. Several risk factors for NMS should be noted in elderly depressive patients whose symptoms often include dehydration, agitation, malnutrition, and exhaustion. Careful therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients who suffer from depression."

False,established dmards sulfasalazine hydroxychloroquine also demonstrated efficacy used together methotrexate nan,11304108,methotrexate,DMARDs,"Because of radiographic evidence of progressive bone loss and the inability to eliminate synovial proliferation with methotrexate, it became apparent that therapy for rheumatoid arthritis needed further advancement. Methotrexate is not a remission-inducing drug and may have dose-limiting toxicity. In the past 2 years, three new disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been approved: leflunomide, etanercept, and infliximab. Each of these agents has demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo in randomized, controlled studies. Because methotrexate had a dominant therapeutic role, the new drugs were also studied in combination with it. Other established DMARDs, such as sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine, have also demonstrated efficacy when used together with methotrexate. The results of these combination studies clearly demonstrate that clinical responses can be meaningfully improved when new and existing DMARDs are added to methotrexate. Although toxicity remains a serious concern when powerful immune modulators and antimetabolites are used in combination, relatively few serious adverse events have been reported during 2-year treatment periods. It has also become apparent that combinations of new DMARDs and methotrexate virtually halt radiographic progression over 2 years. The new agents are expensive, but annual costs must be weighed against the personal and societal expense of joint arthroplasty, hospitalizations, disability, and diminished quality of life that accompanies poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. The ultimate value of combination DMARD therapy with methotrexate will be determined by long-term data on safety, efficacy, and effects on radiographic deterioration of bone. Additional long-term observational data on the incidence of joint arthroplasty and disability will help to place the issue of societal costs in a better perspective. This will allow the value of aggressive treatment to be established with certainty."

The data analyzed by multiple F test indicate that the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and the 2-h postprandial blood glucose (PBG) on the 30th and the 65th days after the food was ingested were significantly reduced (P = 0.001, P less than 0.001, respectively), as was the glycosylated hemoglobin level at the end of the trial (P less than 0.05). The final FBG and PBG of the subjects with initial FBG-O greater than 200 mg% decreased on the average by 51.8 and 84.6 mg%, respectively; those with FBG-O 150-200 mg% decreased by 24.1 and 68.7 mg%; and those with FBG-O less than 150 mg% decreased by 4.8 and 21.4 mg%. No significant changes in blood lipid indexes were observed, except that the triglyceride values of subjects with hypertriglyceridemia (greater than 200 mg%) significantly decreased by 118.7 mg%. It was concluded that Konjac food is very useful in the prevention and treatment of hyperglycemia."

Objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise. Both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial ischemia as evidenced by ST segment depression and angina. However, the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exercise. Exercise-induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while epinephrine-induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product. These findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine, as may occur during states of emotional distress, has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion."

However, it accounts for 10% to 25% of all geriatric patients with mood disorders and 5% of patients admitted to geropsychiatric inpatient units. These patients often present a tremendous treatment challenge to clinicians. They frequently have differing treatment needs compared with their younger counterparts because of substantial medical comorbidity and age-related variations in response to therapy. Unfortunately, the management of geriatric bipolar disorder has been relatively neglected compared with the younger population. There continues to be a scarcity of published, controlled trials in the elderly, and no treatment algorithms specific to bipolar disorder in the elderly have been devised."
True,tacrolimus toxicity due drug interaction mibefradil patient liver transplantationnan,10549098,mibefradil,Tacrolimus toxicity,"A 54-year-old male liver transplant patient received mibefradil, a novel T-type calcium channel blocker, as antihypertensive treatment while he was on tacrolimus. He subsequently developed dizziness and fatigue of gradual onset as well as shoulder muscle ache. In addition, reversible impairment of renal function occurred with an increase in creatinine and potassium levels. Monitoring of tacrolimus levels, which had been in the desired range (5-8 ng/ml) until recently, revealed an increase to toxic level of 54 ng/ml. After discontinuation of mibefradil, tacrolimus levels returned to the normal range and all symptoms and clinical changes were reversible. Mibefradil and tacrolimus both are metabolized through the cytochrome--P-450 pathway. We suspect that drug interaction due to competitive inhibition of tacrolimus metabolism by mibefradil was responsible for these toxic effects. Therefore, special caution is recommended when administering tacrolimus with other drugs that carry the potential for pharmakokinetic interaction."

Exercise-induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while epinephrine-induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product. These findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine, as may occur during states of emotional distress, has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion."
True,epothilones new class mti may associated grade peripheral neuropathy however neuropathy associated ixabepilone novel epothilone analog generally mild moderate reversible baseline grade levelsnan,18567992,Epothilones,neuropathy,"Microtubule inhibitor (MTI)-based chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer--including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones--are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone."

False,clinically reports patients erectile dysfunction ed combined hypogonadism receive testosterone therapy inconsistent resultsnan,18305486,testosterone,hypogonadism,"It is well known that testosterone enhances sexual interest leading to an increased frequency of sexual acts and an increase in the frequency of sleep-related erections. However, it has little effect on fantasy- or visually induced erections. Exact contribution to erection from testosterone in men remains unclear. Animal studies have well demonstrated that testosterone plays critical physiological (activity of nitric oxide synthases and phosphodiesterases), biochemical (through an endothelial-independent pathway and adrenergic tonicity) and structural (change of fibroelasticity and hollow cell accumulation) roles in erectile function. The supplementation of testosterone to castrated animals can restore erectile function. Clinically, reports of patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) combined with hypogonadism who receive testosterone therapy have inconsistent results. However, testosterone may ameliorate the expression of the phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor, and the use of testosterone in conjunction with the PDE5 inhibitor revealed convincing results. Because of potential risks in clinical use, testosterone therapy should be individualized, carefully considered and closely monitored, especially, in patients with possible occult prostate cancer, and large benign prostatic hyperplasia. Lower urinary tract symptoms might be worsened by this treatment, since the prostate is an androgen-dependent tissue."
True,chronic oral cbz inhibited development lidocaine cocaineinduced seizures little effect fully developed local anesthetic seizures nan,2790457,lidocaine,seizures,"The effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) treatment on local anesthetic-kindled seizures and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of CBZ administration. Chronic oral CBZ inhibited the development of both lidocaine- and cocaine-induced seizures, but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic seizures. Chronic CBZ also decreased the incidence of seizure-related mortality in the cocaine-injected rats. Acute CBZ over a range of doses (15-50 mg/kg) had no effect on completed lidocaine-kindled or acute cocaine-induced seizures. Repeated i.p. injection of CBZ (15 mg/kg) also was without effect on the development of lidocaine- or cocaine-kindled seizures. The differential effects of CBZ depending upon stage of seizure development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic-kindled seizures. The effectiveness of chronic but not repeated, intermittent injections of CBZ suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment regimens. The possible utility of chronic CBZ in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human cocaine users is suggested by these data, but remains to be directly evaluated."

We have investigated the effect of retinoic acid (RA) and retinyl acetate (RAc) on the production of reactive oxygen metabolites and the release of lysosomal enzymes by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Incubation of PMN with RAc or RA (1-100 microM) caused a dose-dependent inhibition (upto 90%) in O2- production and chemiluminescence induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylanaline (fMLP), opsonized zymosan or ionophore A23187. Both retinoids (1-100 microM) also inhibited, in a dose-dependent way, degranulation induced by fMLP (upto 85% at the highest concentration of RA). These inhibitory effects appear irreversible, since they persist after the drugs are removed and the cells washed before stimulation. Inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase activity such as acetylsalicyclic acid and indomethacin did not influence the effects of RAc. In contrast, BW755, an inhibitor of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, reversed the inhibitory action of RAc, suggesting that the effect of retinoids occurs possibly through the mediation of lipoxygenase products. The modulation of PMN oxidative metabolism and degranulation might help explain the antiinflammatory properties of retinoids."

Twelve women meeting prospective, DSM-IV criteria for PMDD, five of whom had a history of sexual abuse, participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design study, comparing 2 months of on oral clonidine (0.3 mg/day) with 2 months on active placebo. During the luteal phase that preceded randomization and following each two-month challenge, women were tested for cardiovascular measures at rest and in response to mental stress, and for resting plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations as well as beta1 and beta2-AR responsivity using the isoproterenol sensitivity test. Results revealed that in comparison to placebo, clonidine significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine concentrations, increased both beta1- and beta2-AR responsivity, and reduced resting and stress heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) (p < 0.05) in all PMDD women. With clonidine, sexually abused PMDD women exhibited greater decreases in resting and stress-induced HR (p < 0.01) and stress-induced systolic BP (p < 0.05), while non-abused PMDD women exhibited greater reductions in plasma NE concentration (p = 0.07), and greater increases in beta2-AR responsivity (p < 0.05) than abused PMDD women. These results suggest PMDD women with and without a history of sexual abuse respond differently to a clonidine challenge in measures reflecting autonomic nervous system functioning, indicating that abuse may modify presynaptic alpha2-AR function in PMDD."
False,children adolescents classified metabolic syndrome met three following criteria hypertriglyceridemia low levels highdensity lipoprotein hdl high fasting glucose obesity hypertensionnan,16189445,glucose,hypertriglyceridemia,"The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of potent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. To provide information on the late complications of chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the authors prospectively studied the frequency of overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome in survivors of ALL in the initial years after the completion of therapy. Children and adolescents were classified as having the metabolic syndrome if they met three or more of the following criteria: hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), high fasting glucose, obesity, and hypertension. Obesity was defined on the basis of Body Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m2) standard deviation scores or z-scores. Cutoff points for triglycerides and HDL were taken from equivalent pediatric percentiles with the cutoff points proposed by the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII). Hyperglycemia was defined using the ATPIII cutoff points. Elevated systolic or diastolic blood pressure was defined as a value greater than the 95th percentile for age, gender, and height. Fifty-two subjects (29 male and 23 female) with a median age of 15.2 years (range 6.1-22.6 years) were evaluated. Median interval since completion of therapy was 37 months (range 13-121 months). All of them had been treated according to the ALL-BFM 90 chemotherapy protocol and none had received cranial radiotherapy. Of the 52 subjects, 25 (48%) were overweight (BMI z-score >1.5) and 3 (5.76%) were obese (BMI z-score >2); among them, 1 was severely obese (BMI z-score >2.5). Three criteria for the metabolic syndrome (high triglyceride levels, glucose intolerance, and obesity) were fulfilled by three subjects (5.76%). Twenty-nine subjects (55.7%) had at least one risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Hyperglycemia and hypertension were infrequent. Prompt recognition of the risk factors for metabolic syndrome and intervention seem mandatory to ensure early prevention of cardiovascular disease in survivors of ALL."

Its precise etio-pathogenesis is evasive, genetic influences, exposure to sunlight, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, estrogen-progesterone therapies, thyroid dysfunction, cosmetics, and drugs have been proposed. Centro-facial, malar, and mandibular are well-recognized. Epidermal pigmentation appears brown/black, while dermal is blue in color, and can be distinguished by Wood's lamp illumination. The difference may be inapparent with mixed type of melasma in skin types V and VI. An increase in melanin in epidermis: basal and suprabasal layers and/or dermis is the prime defect. There is an increased expression of tyrosinase related protein-1 involved in eumelanin synthesis. The use of broad-spectrum sunscreen is important, lightening agents like retinoic acid (tretinoin), azelaic acid, and combination therapies containing hydroquinone, tretinoin, and corticosteroids, have been used in the treatment of melasma, and are thought to have increased efficacy as compared with monotherapy. Quasi-drugs, placental extracts, ellagic acid, chamomilla extract, butylresorcinol, tranexamic acid, methoxy potassium salicylate, adenosine monophosphate disodium salt, dipropyl-biphenyl-2,2'-diol, (4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanol, and tranexamic acid cetyl ester hydrochloride, in addition to kojic and ascorbic acid have been used.

False,absence cochleotoxicity measured standard highfrequency pure tone audiometry trial versus threetimesdaily tobramycin cystic fibrosis patientsnan,16801404,tobramycin,cystic fibrosis,"We undertook assessment of hearing in patients with cystic fibrosis who were taking part in a large randomized controlled trial of once- versus three-times-daily tobramycin for pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (the TOPIC study). All patients were eligible to have standard pure tone audiometry performed across the frequency range of 0.25 to 8 kHz. High-frequency pure tone audiometry over 10 to 16 kHz was also performed with a subset of patients. Audiometry was undertaken at the start of tobramycin treatment, at the end of a 14-day course of treatment, and at follow-up 6 to 8 weeks later. We enrolled 244 patients, of whom 219 (125 children and 94 adults) completed treatment. Nineteen patients were excluded from analysis due to abnormal baseline audiometry. Complete pre- and posttreatment standard audiological data were obtained for 168/219 patients. We found no significant differences in hearing thresholds when they were assessed at the baseline, at the end of treatment, and at follow-up 6 to 8 weeks later were compared. In addition, no significant differences in hearing thresholds were detected between treatment regimens. Similar results were obtained for the subset of 63/168 patients who underwent high-frequency audiometry. We conclude that for a single 14-day course of tobramycin treatment in patients with cystic fibrosis with no preexisiting auditory deficit, no measurable effect on hearing was apparent with either once- or three-times-daily treatment. Estimation of the cumulative cochleotoxic risk in cystic fibrosis patients due to repeated aminoglycoside therapy, as evidenced by the patients excluded from this study due to hearing loss, also requires further characterization."

Although clinical studies comparing the efficacy of these 2 drugs have shown that both were effective in the treatment of SAC, the results were contradictory and did not include the effects of these drugs on inflammatory markers."
False,efficacy fixeddose combination therapy treatment patients hypertension focus amlodipine valsartannan,20626210,amlodipine,hypertension,"Early initiation of rational and effective combination therapy consisting of antihypertensive drugs with two different and complementary mechanisms of actions is increasingly becoming accepted in clinical practice and by guidelines as a first-line approach to control blood pressure (BP) and prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Once-daily combination therapy provides more rapid control of BP, which is important for preventing cardiovascular events, with similar or improved tolerability compared with the component monotherapies, and improved adherence because of regimen simplification. Combination therapy with a calcium channel antagonist (calcium channel blocker [CCB]) and an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a rational approach to achieve BP goals and provide protection against renal and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A number of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations, including CCB/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and CCB/ angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) combinations are available as fixed-dose formulations. There is substantial evidence for the BP-lowering efficacy of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations in diverse patient populations, and their use in combination is associated with favourable tolerability and fewer adverse metabolic effects than some other combination therapies. Recent evidence from large outcome trials supports the use of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations for reducing the risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly in high-risk patients, together with evidence that the benefits of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations may extend beyond their efficacy in lowering BP in terms of protecting against fatal and nonfatal stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related deaths. The efficacy of the CCB amlodipine and the ARB valsartan in lowering BP and protecting against cardiovascular events and stroke across a range of hypertensive patient populations has been established over many years. Fixed-dose amlodipine/valsartan combinations are available in many countries and have shown greater BP reductions and better BP control than the respective monotherapies in diverse patient populations, together with a favourable tolerability profile. Once-daily amlodipine/valsartan is a rational and convenient treatment option for the effective management of patients with hypertension, improving adherence to antihypertensive medication and protecting against cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality."
True,glyceryl trinitrate induces attacks migraine without aura sufferers migraine auranan,10524660,Glyceryl trinitrate,migraine without aura,"Migraine with aura and migraine without aura have the same pain phase, thus indicating that migraine with aura and migraine without aura share a common pathway of nociception. In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide (NO) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura. In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura, in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura. The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and/or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced. Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls. Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject. Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008). In the controls, the GTN-induced headache gradually disappeared, whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion. At this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the International Headache Society. The results therefore suggest that NO is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura. Since cortical spreading depression has been shown to liberate NO in animals, this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading depression and headache in migraine with aura."
False,conclusion delapril manidipine effective reduction microalbuminuria normotensive type diabetic patients persistent microalbuminurianan,11336083,manidipine,diabetic,"This study was designed to investigate the effect of delapril, an ACE inhibitor, and manidipine, a long action calcium antagonist, on persistent microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients. Sixty type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to take delapril 30 mg/day or manidipine 10 mg/day for 48 weeks, in an open label design. Twenty eight of thirty subjects in the delapril group and twenty nine of thirty in the manidipine group completed the study. Urine albumin excretion as measured by the urinary albumin creatinine ratio decreased significantly in both groups (112.0+/-60.9 to 95.3+/-64.9 mg/g and 108.5+/-51.0 to 96.4+/-53.5 mg/g in the delapril and manidipine group respectively, p < 0.05, by paired t-test). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly changed after treatment in the delapril group but significantly decreased in the manidipine group (130.9+/-7.1/80.2+/-6.1 to 127.2+/-7.1/78.0+/-5.3 mm/Hg, p < 0.05, by student's paired t-test). After 48 weeks of treatment, two patients in the delapril group and one patient in the manidipine group converted to normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) and one patient in each group progressed to overt nephropathy (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g). There were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, serum fructosamine, creatinine, potassium and lipid profiles after 48 weeks of treatment in both groups. Two cases in the delapril group were withdrawn during the study because of an intolerable cough and one case in the manidipine group because of intolerable dizziness and headache. In conclusion, both delapril and manidipine are effective in the reduction of microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria."

Here we present evidence that chronic oral administration of carvedilol, a nonselective β-adrenergic receptor blocker, significantly attenuates brain oligomeric β-amyloid content and cognitive deterioration in 2 independent AD mouse models. We found that carvedilol treatment significantly improved neuronal transmission, and that this improvement was associated with the maintenance of number of the less stable ""learning"" thin spines in the brains of AD mice. Our novel observation that carvedilol interferes with the neuropathologic, biochemical, and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deterioration in AD supports the potential development of carvedilol as a treatment for AD."
False,although recent studies suggest opioid rotation could effective treatment strategy morphineinduced delirium prospective studies investigate treatment effects opioid rotation using fentanyl nan,16043013,fentanyl,opioid rotation,"Although recent studies suggest that opioid rotation could be an effective treatment strategy for morphine-induced delirium, there have been no prospective studies to investigate the treatment effects of opioid rotation using fentanyl. The primary aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in symptom palliation of morphine-induced delirium. Twenty-one consecutive cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium underwent opioid rotation to fentanyl. Physicians recorded the symptom severity of delirium (the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, MDAS), pain, and other symptoms (categorical verbal scale from 0: none to 3: severe) and the Schedule for Team Assessment Scale (STAS) (from 0: none to 4: extreme); and performance status at the time of study enrollment and three and seven days after. Of 21 patients recruited, one patient did not complete the study. In the remaining 20 patients, morphine was substituted with transdermal fentanyl in 9 patients and parenteral fentanyl in 11 patients. Total opioid dose increased from 64 mg oral morphine equivalent/day (Day 0) to 98 mg/day (Day 7), and the median increase in total opioid dose was 42%. Treatment success, defined as an MDAS score below 10 and pain score of 2 or less, was obtained in 13 patients on Day 3 and 18 patients on Day 7. The mean MDAS score significantly decreased from 14 (Day 0) to 6.4 and 3.6 (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Pain scores significantly decreased from 2.2 (Day 0) to 1.3 and 1.1 on the categorical verbal scale (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001); from 2.6 (Day 0) to 1.6 and 1.3 on the STAS (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Symptom scores of dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting significantly decreased, and performance status significantly improved. Opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl may be effective in alleviating delirium and pain in cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium."
True,melatonin induces apoptosis hepatocellular carcinoma hcc experimental studies effects melatonin endoplasmic reticulum er stressinduced apoptosis hcc testednan,22225575,Melatonin,HCC/apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated cell apoptosis is implicated in the development of cancer. Melatonin induces apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in experimental studies, but the effects of melatonin on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis in HCC have not been tested. Differences in ER stress-induced apoptosis in human hepatoma cells and normal human hepatocyte were investigated by exposure to tunicamycin (ER stress inducer). Significant differences were observed in the rate of apoptosis between HepG2 cells (hepatoma cells) and HL-7702 cells (normal human hepatocyte cells). The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was increased in HepG2 cells but not in HL-7702 cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of COX-2 expression using the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, increased tunicamycin-induced apoptosis concomitant with the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP (GADD153) and down-regulation of B-cell lymphoma 2/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bcl-2/Bax) ratio, suggesting that inhibition of COX-2 sensitized human hepatoma cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, co-treatment with tunicamycin and melatonin also decreased the expression of COX-2 and significantly increased the rate of apoptosis by elevating the levels of CHOP and reducing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. These results demonstrate that melatonin sensitizes human hepatoma cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis by down-regulating COX-2 expression, increasing the levels of CHOP and decreasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio."

True,adhesion lung metastasis human melanoma cells nod scid mice also potentiated cotreatment 12(s)-hete nan,23664097,12(S)-HETE,SCID,"12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) is a non-haeme iron-containing dioxygenase that forms 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) or 15(S)-HETE. Several biological mediators including cytokines, growth factors and lipid metabolites released during tumour cell-endothelial cell adhesion are associated with malignant tumour progression. Here we found that HETEs released from the host organ played a critical role in tumour metastasis. Intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma cells caused lung nodule formation, which was markedly attenuated in 12/15-LOX null mice. Co-injection of melanoma cells with 12(S)-HETE increased the lung homing activity of B16F10 melanoma cells. In vitro studies showed that 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent increase of adhesion of B16F10 cells on collagen or fibronectin. The melanoma cell adhesion was then evaluated in pulmonary primary cell culture isolated from wild-type (WT) and 12/15-LOX knockout (KO) mice. It was found that the adhesion of melanoma cells on the epithelial cells isolated from 12/15-LOX null mice was reduced in comparison with those isolated from WT mice. Treatment of 12(S)-HETE increased the pFAK in melanoma cells adhering on collagen-coated slide. The enhancement of adherence elicited by 12(S)-HETE in B16F10 cells could be antagonised by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor 14 (FAK inhibitor) or PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor). 12(S)-HETE increased the phosphorylation of FAK and ERK in adhering melanoma cells. The FAK phosphorylation induced by 12(S)-HETE was further inhibited by PD98059, indicating that FAK is the downstream target of ERK. The adhesion and lung metastasis of human melanoma cells of C32 in NOD/SCID mice were also potentiated by co-treatment with 12(S)-HETE. These results demonstrate that 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE activates ERK and FAK signalling pathways, thereby upregulates the adhesion and metastatic potential of melanoma cells. The endogenous release of 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE in the host organ may affect the metastatic potential of melanoma. "
False,review describes emerging immunological properties thalidomide historical context presentday clinical applications notably multiple myeloma also cancers inflammatory disease hivnan,12803319,thalidomide,cancers,"Thalidomide has recently shown considerable promise in the treatment of a number of conditions, such as leprosy and cancer. Its effectiveness in the clinic has been ascribed to wide-ranging properties, including anti-TNF-alpha, T-cell costimulatory and antiangiogenic activity. Novel compounds with improved immunomodulatory activity and side effect profiles are also being evaluated. These include selective cytokine inhibitory drugs (SelCIDs), with greatly improved TNF-alpha inhibitory activity, and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) that are structural analogs of thalidomide, with improved properties. A third group recently identified within the SelCID group, with phosphodiesterase type 4-independent activity, is in the process of being characterized in laboratory studies. This review describes the emerging immunological properties of thalidomide, from a historical context to present-day clinical applications, most notably in multiple myeloma but also in other cancers, inflammatory disease, and HIV. We also describe the laboratory studies that have led to the characterization and development of SelCIDs and IMiDs into potentially clinically relevant drugs. Early trial data suggest that these novel immunomodulatory compounds may supercede thalidomide to become established therapies, particularly in certain cancers. Further evidence is required, however, to correlate the clinical efficacy of these compounds with their known immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, and antitumor properties."

Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the trial. Allocation of patients into coumadin or aspirin groups depended upon the patients' choice. Nineteen patients were given coumadin at the adjusted dosage to maintain the therapeutic range of International Normalised Ratio between 1.5-3. Sixty patients were given aspirin at the fixed dosage of 75 mg per day. Six patients were lost to follow-up over the 3 yr period; four in the aspirin group and 2 in the coumadin group. There were three patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke in the aspirin group but none in the coumadin group after three years of follow-up. Six patients had mitral valve replacement during the study (i.e. three patients in each group). There were complications in 12 patients, 10 in the aspirin (16.6 per cent) and 2 in the coumadin (10.5 per cent) group. The complications in coumadin group were minor bleeding over the thigh in one patient and generalised ecchymosis over the whole body in one other. In the aspirin group, the complication was gastrointestional symptoms, mainly epigastric pain, but no frank bleeding was observed. Primary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in chronic rheumatic heart disease was found to be more effective with coumadin than aspirin. Our study does not support the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiac embolism in chronic rheumatic heart disease."

Twenty-six had minimal prior therapy (good risk), 23 had extensive prior therapy (poor risk), and six had renal and/or hepatic dysfunction. A total of 167 courses at doses of 15 to 70 mg/m2 were evaluable. Maximum tolerated dose in good-risk patients was 70 mg/m2, and in poor-risk patients, 60 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxic effect was transient noncumulative granulocytopenia. Granulocyte nadir was on day 14 (range, 4-22). Less frequent toxic effects included thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, mild alopecia, phlebitis, and mucositis. Myelosuppression was more in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Pharmacokinetic analyses in 21 patients revealed Pirarubicin plasma T 1/2 alpha (+/- SE) of 2.5 +/- 0.85 minutes, T beta 1/2 of 25.6 +/- 6.5 minutes, and T 1/2 gamma of 23.6 +/- 7.6 hours. The area under the curve was 537 +/- 149 ng/ml x hours, volume of distribution (Vd) 3504 +/- 644 l/m2, and total clearance (ClT) was 204 + 39.3 l/hour/m2. Adriamycinol, doxorubicin, adriamycinone, and tetrahydropyranyladriamycinol were the metabolites detected in plasma and the amount of doxorubicin was less than or equal to 10% of the total metabolites. Urinary excretion of Pirarubicin in the first 24 hours was less than or equal to 10%. Activity was noted in mesothelioma, leiomyosarcoma, and basal cell carcinoma. The recommended starting dose for Phase II trials is 60 mg/m2 IV bolus every 3 weeks."
True,oxaliplatin results colorectal carcinoma nan,12398998,Oxaliplatin,colorectal carcinoma,"Oxaliplatin, a platinum compound characterized by a diaminocyclohexane (DACH) platinum carrier ligand, has proven its efficacy in first- and second-line advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. Acute reversible and cumulative peripheral sensory neuropathy has been observed frequently with oxaliplatin treatment and limits its use. Its synergism with other drugs, as well as its different mechanism of action and toxicity profile make it an attractive candidate for combination studies in CRC. It can be combined safely with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)+/-folinic acid (LV), irinotecan, raltitrexed, multitarget antifolate LY231514 (MTA), and oral 5-FU prodrugs. These combinations confer both an increased response rate compared to that of any single agent and an increased secondary surgical resection of initially unresectable metastases, possibly leading to prolonged survival. In three prospective randomized phase III studies in advanced CRC, oxaliplatin plus 5-FU/LV improved significantly progression-free survival without a significant increase in median survival time and without affecting quality of life, compared to treatment with 5-FU/LV. Ongoing clinical trials will define its role in the adjuvant setting."

However, an unacceptable increase in disability from Parkinsonism with aggravation of end-of-dose akinesia led to its cessation in 14 patients. Tiapride had no effect on levodopa-induced early morning of ""off-period"" segmental dystonia. These results fail to support the notion that levodopa-induced dyskinesias are caused by overstimulation of a separate group of dopamine receptors."

True,present study undertaken investigate effects tet fan experimental thrombosis induced collagen plus epinephrine ep mice platelet aggregation blood coagulation vitrothrombosis induced caused collagen epinephrine,10193204,epinephrine/EP,thrombosis,"Tetrandrine (TET) and fangchinoline (FAN) are two naturally occurring analogues with a bisbenzylisoquinoline structure. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of TET and FAN on the experimental thrombosis induced by collagen plus epinephrine (EP) in mice, and platelet aggregation and blood coagulation in vitro. In the in vivo study, the administration (50 mg/kg, i.p.) of TET and FAN in mice showed the inhibition of thrombosis by 55% and 35%, respectively, while acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 50 mg/kg, i.p.), a positive control, showed only 30% inhibition. In the vitro human platelet aggregations induced by the agonists used in tests, TET and FAN showed the inhibitions dose dependently. In addition, neither TET nor FAN showed any anticoagulation activities in the measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT) using human-citrated plasma. These results suggest that antithrombosis of TET and FAN in mice may be mainly related to the antiplatelet aggregation activities."
False,conclusion hfdinduced obese rats highly sensitized doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial atp generation increasing oxidative stress downregulating jakstat pathwaynan,18674790,doxorubicin,obese,"Often, chemotherapy by doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is limited due to life threatening cardiotoxicity in patients during and posttherapy. Recently, we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and triglycerides and increased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation, ATP synthesis, and upregulated JAK/STAT3 pathway. In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high fat diet (HFD), which induces obesity in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. A LD(10) dose (8 mg doxorubicin/kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher cardiotoxicity, cardiac dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in the obese (OB) rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity. Doxorubicin toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol (toxic metabolite) in the normal diet-fed (ND) and OB hearts. Mechanistic studies revealed that OB rats are sensitized due to: (1) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, (2) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, (3) decreased plasma adiponectin levels, (4) decreased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation (666.9+/-14.0 nmol/min/g heart in ND versus 400.2+/-11.8 nmol/min/g heart in OB), (5) decreased mitochondrial AMP-alpha2 protein kinase, and (6) 86% drop in cardiac ATP levels accompanied by decreased ATP/ADP ratio after doxorubicin administration. Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK/STAT3 pathway. In conclusion, HFD-induced obese rats are highly sensitized to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial ATP generation, increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the JAK/STAT3 pathway."
False,present evidence chronic oral administration carvedilol nonselective adrenergic receptor blocker significantly attenuates brain oligomeric amyloid content cognitive deterioration independent ad mouse modelsnan,20579773,carvedilol,AD mouse,"Oligomeric β-amyloid (Aβ) has recently been linked to synaptic plasticity deficits, which play a major role in progressive cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we present evidence that chronic oral administration of carvedilol, a nonselective β-adrenergic receptor blocker, significantly attenuates brain oligomeric β-amyloid content and cognitive deterioration in 2 independent AD mouse models. We found that carvedilol treatment significantly improved neuronal transmission, and that this improvement was associated with the maintenance of number of the less stable ""learning"" thin spines in the brains of AD mice. Our novel observation that carvedilol interferes with the neuropathologic, biochemical, and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deterioration in AD supports the potential development of carvedilol as a treatment for AD."
False,high csa associated elevated ggt probably cholestatic effects explain increased mpag tompa rationan,16359376,MPAG,GGT,"Therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolic acid (MPA) in combination with cyclosporine 2-h concentration (CsA C2, n = 68) or tacrolimus trough concentration (n = 10) was investigated by repeated measurements of MPA and MPA-glucuronide (MPAG) trough concentrations in renal allograft recipients during the first 3 months post-transplant. The acute rejection rate was lower (19% vs. 43%; P < 0.05) in patients achieving CsA C2 target range during the first week (1600-2000 microg/l), n = 26, compared with those who did not, n = 42. Median MPA concentration was 0.9 and 1.2 microg/ml in patients within or below C2 range, respectively (P = 0.19). CsA C2 correlated with MPAG-to-MPA ratio (P < 0.01, r = 0.91) and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT, P < 0.01, r = 0.86). Total MPA concentration increased during the 3 months, but not in patients on tacrolimus. High CsA C2 lowered the acute rejection rate and plasma MPA. High CsA C2 is associated with elevated GGT, probably because of cholestatic effects, which explain the increased MPAG-to-MPA ratio. Increasing MPA concentration is ascribed to per-protocol CsA C2 reductions. In conclusion, CsA may confound the relationship between MPA and the incidence of rejection, and contribute to the difficulty of obtaining a therapeutic range for MPA in clinical practice."
True,gallstones recovered two patients found high cholesterol content suggesting formed cholesterol supersaturated bilenanstone high cholesterol wasnt caused,1385654,cholesterol,Gallstones,"Five out of forty-five adult men, 50 years of age or less, who had received, for at least six months, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, Depo Provera) IM, 200-400 mg/week, for prevention of sex-offending or genital-mutilating behavior developed symptomatic cholelithiasis. Thirty of these men were studied with gallbladder ultrasound prospectively off MPA and at six-month intervals while taking the medication and then six months off MPA. Gallstones recovered from two patients were found to have very high cholesterol content, suggesting they were formed in cholesterol supersaturated bile. These findings are consistent with the increased incidence of gallbladder disease related to high-progesterone states and suggest that MPA may be a causative agent in cholelithiasis. The physiologic studies on gallbladder contraction and cholecystokinin release in a subset of the patients failed to provide information on a mechanism for the possible increased incidence of gallbladder disease."

True,estrogens involved breast cancer onset progression response steap 17beta-estradiol investigated mammary gland rats human breast cancer cell line mcfnan,18958632,estrogens,breast cancer,"Six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) was identified as a prostate-specific cell-surface antigen over-expressed in prostate cancer, and in human cancer cell lines obtained from several other tissues. Its cell surface location in all tumor types analyzed so far, and its absence in most vital organs in humans, turned STEAP1 into a potential target for anti-tumor immunotherapy. This study provides experimental evidence that STEAP1 is also over-expressed in human breast cancer cases, and in normal breast tissue adjacent to breast tumors, where it is localized in the cell membrane of epithelial cells. It is also demonstrated that STEAP1 transcription correlates negatively with estrogen receptor (ER) immunoreactivity, and positively with tumor grading in breast cancer cases. As estrogens are involved in breast cancer onset and progression, the response of STEAP1 to 17beta-estradiol (E2) was investigated in the mammary gland of rats, and in the human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. These experiments demonstrated that STEAP1 is down-regulated by E2 in both models. The mechanisms underlying the STEAP1 response to E2 in vitro were further investigated in MCF-7 cells, and the results obtained suggest an effect mediated by the membrane-bound ERalpha (mbERalpha)."
True,treatment resistant cells verapamil intracellular levels doxorubicin markedly increased consequent cytotoxicity improvednanimproved key term,11261883,doxorubicin,cytotoxicity,"A well-known mechanism leading to the emergence of multidrug-resistant tumor cells is the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is capable of lowering intracellular drug concentrations. To overcome this problem, we tested the capability of two peptide vectors that are able to cross cellular membranes to deliver doxorubicin in P-gp-expressing cells. The antitumor effect of peptide-conjugated doxorubicin was tested in human erythroleukemic (K562/ ADR) resistant cells. The conjugate showed potent dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth against K562/ADR cells as compared with doxorubicin alone. Doxorubicin exhibited IC50 concentrations of 65 microM in the resistant cells, whereas vectorized doxorubicin was more effective with IC50 concentrations of 3 microM. After treatment of the resistant cells with verapamil, the intracellular levels of doxorubicin were markedly increased and consequent cytotoxicity was improved. In contrast, treatment of resistant cells with verapamil did not cause any further enhancement in the cell uptake nor in the cytotoxic effect of the conjugated doxorubicin, indicating that the conjugate bypasses the P-gp. Finally, we show by the in situ brain perfusion method in P-gp-deficient and competent mice that vectorized doxorubicin bypasses the P-gp present at the luminal site of the blood-brain barrier. These results indicate that vectorization of doxorubicin with peptide vectors is effective in overcoming multidrug resistance."
True,contraindicated management acute postoperative pain pain may decrease rapidly circumstances fentanyl blood levels adjusted leading development lifethreatening hypoventilation nan,14583070,fentanyl,hypoventilation,"Transdermal fentanyl is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of chronic pain caused by malignancy and non-malignant conditions when administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Compared with oral opioids, the advantages of transdermal fentanyl include a lower incidence and impact of adverse effects (constipation, nausea and vomiting, and daytime drowsiness), a higher degree of patient satisfaction, improved quality of life, improved convenience and compliance resulting from administration every 72 hours, and decreased use of rescue medication. Transdermal fentanyl is a useful analgesic for cancer patients who are unable to swallow or have gastrointestinal problems. Transdermal fentanyl forms a depot within the upper skin layers before entering the microcirculation. Therapeutic blood levels are attained 12-16 hours after patch application and decrease slowly with a half-life of 16-22 hours following removal. Patients with chronic pain should be titrated to adequate relief with short-acting oral or parenteral opioids prior to the initiation of transdermal fentanyl in order to prevent exacerbations of pain or opioid-related adverse effects. Transdermal fentanyl can then be initiated based on the 24-hour opioid requirement once adequate analgesia has been achieved. The prolonged elimination of transdermal fentanyl can become problematic if patients develop opioid-related adverse effects, especially hypoventilation. Adverse effects do not improve immediately after patch removal and may take many hours to resolve. Patients who experience opioid-related toxicity associated with respiratory depression should be treated immediately with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone and closely monitored for at least 24 hours. Because of the short half-life of naloxone, sequential doses or a continuous infusion of the opioid antagonist may be necessary. Transdermal fentanyl should be administered cautiously to patients with pre-existing conditions such as emphysema that may predispose them to the development of hypoventilation. Transdermal fentanyl is indicated only for patients who require continuous opioid administration for the treatment of chronic pain that cannot be managed with other medications. It is contraindicated in the management of acute and postoperative pain, as pain may decrease more rapidly in these circumstances than fentanyl blood levels can be adjusted, leading to the development of life-threatening hypoventilation. Cognitive and physical impairments such as confusion and abnormal co-ordination can occur with transdermal fentanyl. Therefore, patients should be instructed to refrain from driving or operating machinery immediately following the initiation of transdermal fentanyl, or after any dosage increase. Patients may resume such activities once the absence of these potential adverse effects is documented."

True,animal experiments highdose exposure cd induced severe testicular interstitial hemorrhage edema increased incidence fetal death placental necrosisnan,16788562,Cd,fetal death,"Cadmium (Cd) is an industrial and environmental pollutant that exerts adverse effects on a number of organs in humans and animals. Reproductive organs, such as the testis and placenta, are sensitive to the toxic effects of Cd. In animal experiments, high-dose exposure to Cd induced severe testicular interstitial hemorrhage with edema, and increased incidence of fetal death and placental necrosis. Low-dose exposure to Cd affects steroid synthesis in male and female reproductive organs. In 1998, the Ministry of Environment in Japan listed Cd in the strategy plan SPEED98 as one of the chemicals suspected of having possible endocrine disrupting activity. Recently, it has been shown that Cd has potent estrogen- and androgen-like activities in vivo and in vitro, by directly binding to estrogen and androgen receptors. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of Cd as an endocrine disruptor remain to be elucidated. In this review, we will discuss evidence thus far presented concerning the effects of Cd on the endocrine system."

Here, we report the favourable outcome in 81 paediatric APL patients treated according to the consecutive acute myeloid leukaemia-Berlin/Frankfurt/Muenster (AML-BFM) trials -93/-98/-2004 with an anthracycline-cytarabine regimen in combination with all-trans-retinoid acid (ATRA). Outcomes achieved by treatment with a reduced cumulative anthracycline dose (350 mg/m(2)) were comparable to those reported for studies with higher doses. Five-year overall survival of the total cohort was 89 +/- 4% and event-free survival (pEFS) was 73 +/- 6%. Overall survival was similar when comparing AML-BFM trial periods (trial 93: 88 +/- 8%, 98: 85 +/- 7% and 2004: 94 +/- 8%, P((logrank)) = 0.63). Seventy-five (93%) patients achieved complete remission. Most fatal events occurred during the first 6 weeks of treatment. Long-term cardiotoxicity was observed in one patient. Two patients suffered from secondary haematological malignancies. Salvage treatment was effective in 7/9 patients (78%) with relapsed APL, who now are long-term survivors after second line combination treatment with arsenic trioxide (4/7 patients) and stem cell transplantation (5/7 patients). Our results demonstrate that - combined with ATRA - a lower cumulative anthracycline dose can be used safely to maintain high cure rates and promote the reduction of long-term sequelae, such as cardiotoxicity in APL patients."

The present review focuses on the several adverse health effects of acrylamide including mutagenicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, and the possible outcomes of childhood exposure from baby foods and infant formulas."
False,areas schistosome hookworm coexist praziquantel recommended schistosomiasis control largescale application drug might also reduce burden hookwormsnan,12062494,praziquantel,hookworm coexist,"Praziquantel exhibits activity against all major human schistosome parasites and has become the cornerstone for treatment and morbidity control of schistosomiasis. Praziquantel is also active against a wide range of trematodes, human and veterinary cestodes and displays cysticidal effects. To the best of our knowledge anthelminthic properties have never been documented. Here, we report a study among 96 schoolchildren from an area highly endemic for Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm infection, and place particular emphasis on the effect of praziquantel on the prevalence and intensity of hookworm infections. Stool specimens were screened over several consecutive days prior and 4 weeks after systematic administration of praziquantel. We found a significant reduction in the prevalence of hookworm infection from 75.0 to 40.6% (odds ratio (OR)=0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.11-0.40). Infection intensities, expressed by geometric mean egg counts of all children, were also reduced significantly from 10.7 to 2.0 eggs per gram stool (paired t-test=7.78, P<0.001). If these findings are confirmed in other epidemiological settings - following a similarly sensitive diagnostic approach - they might become of considerable relevance. In areas where both schistosome and hookworm coexist, and praziquantel is being recommended for schistosomiasis control, large-scale application of this drug might also reduce the burden of hookworms."

True,given doxorubicin docetaxel th complements enhances anticancer effects perivascular hypoxic regions also increases toxicity nan,24338277,docetaxel,toxicity,"Many chemotherapy drugs have poor therapeutic activity in regions distant from tumor blood vessels because of poor tissue penetration and low cytotoxic activity against slowly-proliferating cells. The hypoxia-activated pro-drug TH-302 may have selective toxicity for hypoxic and neighboring cells in tumors. Here we characterize the spatial distribution and ability of TH-302 to selectively target hypoxic regions and complement the effect of doxorubicin and docetaxel by modifying biomarker distribution. Athymic nude mice bearing human breast MCF-7 or prostate PC-3 tumors were treated with doxorubicin or docetaxel respectively and TH-302 alone or in combination. Biomarkers of drug effect including γH2aX (a marker of DNA damage), cleaved caspase-3 or -6 (markers of apoptosis) and reduction in Ki-67 (a marker of cell proliferation) were quantified in tumor sections in relation to functional blood vessels (recognized by DiOC7) and hypoxia (recognized by EF5) using immunohistochemistry. γH2aX expression at 10 min and cleaved caspase-3 or -6 at 24 hr after doxorubicin or docetaxel decreased with increasing distance from tumor blood vessels, with minimal expression in hypoxic regions; maximum reduction in Ki67 levels was observed in regions closest to vasculature at 24 hr. TH-302 induced maximal cell damage in hypoxic and neighboring regions, but was also active in tumor regions closer to blood vessels. TH-302 given 4 hr before doxorubicin or docetaxel increased DNA damage and apoptosis throughout the tumor compared to chemotherapy alone. When given with doxorubicin or docetaxel, TH-302 complements and enhances anticancer effects in both perivascular and hypoxic regions but also increases toxicity."
True,two halogenated anesthetics enflurane isoflurane associated allergictype hepatic injury alone following previous exposure halothanenan,7647582,enflurane,hepatic injury,"Two halogenated anesthetics, enflurane and isoflurane, have been associated with an allergic-type hepatic injury both alone and following previous exposure to halothane. Halothane hepatitis appears to involve an aberrant immune response. An antibody response to a protein-bound biotransformation product (trifluoroacetyl adduct) has been detected on halothane hepatitis patients. This study was performed to determine cross-reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by halothane. The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by halothane-induced antibodies following enflurane and isoflurane, and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models. Enflurane administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver. In the same liver, biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20-fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats. This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which enflurane and/or isoflurane could produce a hypersensitivity condition similar to that of halothane hepatitis either alone or subsequent to halothane administration. The guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens."

Melatonin induces apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in experimental studies, but the effects of melatonin on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis in HCC have not been tested. Differences in ER stress-induced apoptosis in human hepatoma cells and normal human hepatocyte were investigated by exposure to tunicamycin (ER stress inducer). Significant differences were observed in the rate of apoptosis between HepG2 cells (hepatoma cells) and HL-7702 cells (normal human hepatocyte cells). The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was increased in HepG2 cells but not in HL-7702 cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of COX-2 expression using the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, increased tunicamycin-induced apoptosis concomitant with the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP (GADD153) and down-regulation of B-cell lymphoma 2/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bcl-2/Bax) ratio, suggesting that inhibition of COX-2 sensitized human hepatoma cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, co-treatment with tunicamycin and melatonin also decreased the expression of COX-2 and significantly increased the rate of apoptosis by elevating the levels of CHOP and reducing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. These results demonstrate that melatonin sensitizes human hepatoma cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis by down-regulating COX-2 expression, increasing the levels of CHOP and decreasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio."

False,berberine bbr isoquinoline derivative alkaloid isolated chinese herbs long history uses treatment multiple diseases including cancers nan,23869238,Berberine,cancers,"Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline derivative alkaloid isolated from Chinese herbs, has a long history of uses for the treatment of multiple diseases, including cancers. However, the precise mechanisms of actions of BBR in human lung cancer cells remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which BBR inhibits cell growth in human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Treatment with BBR promoted cell morphology change, inhibited cell migration, proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell apoptosis. Further molecular mechanism study showed that BBR simultaneously targeted multiple cell signaling pathways to inhibit NSCLC cell growth. Treatment with BBR inhibited AP-2α and AP-2β expression and abrogated their binding on hTERT promoters, thereby inhibiting hTERT expression. Knockdown of AP-2α and AP-2β by siRNA considerably augmented the BBR-mediated inhibition of cell growth. BBR also suppressed the nuclear translocation of p50/p65 NF-κB proteins and their binding to COX-2 promoter, causing inhibition of COX-2. BBR also downregulated HIF-1α and VEGF expression and inhibited Akt and ERK phosphorylation. Knockdown of HIF-1α by siRNA considerably augmented the BBR-mediated inhibition of cell growth. Moreover, BBR treatment triggered cytochrome-c release from mitochondrial inter-membrane space into cytosol, promoted cleavage of caspase and PARP, and affected expression of BAX and Bcl-2, thereby activating apoptotic pathway. Taken together, these results demonstrated that BBR inhibited NSCLC cell growth by simultaneously targeting AP-2/hTERT, NF-κB/COX-2, HIF-1α/VEGF, PI3K/AKT, Raf/MEK/ERK and cytochrome-c/caspase signaling pathways. Our findings provide new insights into understanding the anticancer mechanisms of BBR in human lung cancer therapy. "
False,purpose cisplatin plus fluorouracil pf induction chemotherapy compared taxane docetaxel paclitaxel cisplatin fluorouracil taxpf randomized trials locoregionally advanced head neck cancers lahncsnan,23835714,taxane,head and neck cancers,"PURPOSE Cisplatin plus fluorouracil (PF) induction chemotherapy has been compared with taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel), cisplatin, and fluorouracil (Tax-PF) in randomized trials in locoregionally advanced head and neck cancers (LAHNCs). The aim of this meta-analysis was to study the efficacy and toxicity of Tax-PF and PF and identify differences in outcomes in subsets of patients. METHODS Five randomized trials representing 1,772 patients were identified. Updated individual patient data (IPD) were retrieved for all trials. The log-rank test, stratified by trial, was used for comparison. Interaction or trend tests were used to study the interaction between covariates and treatment. Results Median follow-up was 4.9 years. The hazard ratio (HR) of death was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.89; P < .001; absolute benefit at 5 years: 7.4%) in favor of Tax-PF. Heterogeneity was significant (P = .08, I(2) = 51%) and related to one trial. There was no more heterogeneity after exclusion of this trial (P = .99, I(2) = 0%), and HR of death was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.83) in favor of Tax-PF. There was no interaction between treatment effect and the following patient covariates: age, sex, performance status, tumor stage, or site. Tax-PF was associated with significant reductions of progression, locoregional failure, and distant failure compared with PF, with HRs of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.87; P < .001), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.94; P = .007), and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.89; P = .009) respectively. CONCLUSION This IPD meta-analysis shows the superiority of Tax-PF over PF as induction chemotherapy. Its precise role in the management of LAHNC remains to be determined. "
False,considering prevalence pyrazinamide resistance different clinical settings pcrdna sequencing possibly molecular assays targeting pnca detect pyrazinamide resistance multidrugresistant tuberculosis isolates predictive values largely exceeding rule pyrazinamide resistance nonmultidrugresistant isolates predictive values exceeding nan,21768515,pyrazinamide,tuberculosis,"Standard culture-based testing of the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to pyrazinamide is difficult to perform. This systematic review with meta-analyses evaluated the roles of molecular assays targeting pncA and of pyrazinamidase assays. PubMed and Embase were searched for relevant publications in English. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated in bivariate random-effects models. Of 128 articles identified, 73 sets of data involving culture isolates were initially included in meta-analyses. Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were 87% and 93% for PCR-DNA sequencing (n = 29), 75% and 95% for PCR-single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) (n = 5), 96% and 97% for a mixture of other molecular assays (n = 6), and 89% and 97% for pyrazinamidase assays using the Wayne method (n = 33). The median prevalence (range) of pyrazinamide resistance was 51% (31% to 89%) in multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates and 5% (0% to 9%) in non-multidrug-resistant isolates. Excluding studies with possibly considerable false resistance in the reference assay gave the following estimates of sensitivity and specificity, respectively: 92% and 93% for PCR-DNA sequencing (n = 20), 98% and 96% for other molecular assays (n = 5), and 91% and 97% for the Wayne assay (n = 27). The Wayne assay had significant funnel plot asymmetry, so the test performance might have been overestimated. Considering the prevalence of pyrazinamide resistance in different clinical settings, PCR-DNA sequencing, and possibly other molecular assays targeting pncA, can detect pyrazinamide resistance in multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates, with predictive values largely exceeding 90%, and rule out pyrazinamide resistance in non-multidrug-resistant isolates, with predictive values exceeding 99%. Molecular assays are probably the way forward for detecting pyrazinamide resistance."
True,tolerability profile generally consistent vegf receptor inhibitors axitinib associated numerically lower incidence palmarplantar erythrodysaesthesia cutaneous toxicity anaemia sorafenib phase iii trialnan,23190347,axitinib,anaemia,"Axitinib is a new inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1-3, with greater inhibition potency than existing VEGF receptor inhibitors sunitinib, sorafenib and pazopanib. In a pivotal phase III trial in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma that had progressed despite first-line therapy, axitinib 5 mg twice daily significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (primary endpoint) compared with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. A significant between-group difference favouring axitinib over sorafenib in terms of progression-free survival was maintained in the subgroups of patients who had previously received cytokine or sunitinib therapy. However, median overall survival was not significantly different between the treatment groups. Significantly more axitinib than sorafenib recipients achieved an objective response, and axitinib therapy significantly prolonged time to deterioration (a composite endpoint of death, disease progression and symptom worsening) relative to sorafenib therapy. While its tolerability profile was generally consistent with that of other VEGF receptor inhibitors, axitinib was associated with a numerically lower incidence of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia, cutaneous toxicity and anaemia than sorafenib in the phase III trial."

The long term effectiveness and adverse effects of this drug combination for the treatment of HIV were evaluated in an ambispective study at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Nonthaburi Province, Thailand from March 2002 to January 2006. A total of 152 adult treatment naive HIV patients who had received at least 12 months of GPO-VIR were enrolled. The median (IQR) CD4 cell count increased from 23 (8-94) cells/microl at baseline to 126 (38-180), 136 (98-189), 199 (141-255) and 334 (243-414) cells/microl at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months (p < 0.001), respectively. The median (IQR) percentage of body weights increased from baseline by 3.0% (0.3-6.3), 6.2% (2.2-9.3), 7.3% (3.9-10.9) and 8.1% (3.4-11.9) at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively and then remained at a plateau until the end of the 3-year study. The occurrence of new opportunistic infections decreased significantly (p < 0.001) with GPO-VIR treatment. Drug resistance occurred in 5 cases (3.3%) with a median (IQR) time of 18.0 (16.5-32.5) months to occurrence. Adverse effects included hypercholesterolemia (43.2%), lipodystrophy (35.5%), hypertriglyceridemia (25%), hypertension (13.1%), peripheral neuropathy (11.9%), hyperlactatemia (2.6%) and lactic acidosis (1.3%). Thirty-six patients (27%) switched from GPO-VIR to other anti-retroviral drugs regimens due to lipodystrophy. This study showed GPO-VIR had clinical and immunological benefits, but one-third of patients had adverse effects."
True,hand mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsions evoked carbachol eserine significantly changed calcium chloridenan,6892185,carbachol,clonic-tonic convulsions,"The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."
True,results support major role free radical generation adr toxicity well suggesting mitochondria critical site cardiac injurynan,8787689,ADR,toxicity,"Adriamycin (ADR) is a potent anticancer drug known to cause severe cardiac toxicity. Although ADR generates free radicals, the role of free radicals in the development of cardiac toxicity and the intracellular target for ADR-induced cardiac toxicity are still not well understood. We produced three transgenic mice lines expressing increased levels of human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial enzyme, as an animal model to investigate the role of ADR-mediated free radical generation in mitochondria. The human MnSOD was expressed, functionally active, and properly transported into mitochondria in the heart of transgenic mice. The levels of copper-zinc SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase did not change in the transgenic mice. Electron microscopy revealed dose-dependent ultrastructural alterations with marked mitochondrial damage in nontransgenic mice treated with ADR, but not in the transgenic littermates. Biochemical analysis indicated that the levels of serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in ADR-treated mice were significantly greater in nontransgenic than their transgenic littermates expressing a high level of human MnSOD after ADR treatment. These results support a major role for free radical generation in ADR toxicity as well as suggesting mitochondria as the critical site of cardiac injury."

In the current study, we sought to confirm the preliminary observations in HES as well as evaluate the therapeutic value of imatinib in eos-CMD that is not associated with t(5;12)(q33;p13). Five patients with HES (all men, median age = 46 years) and 2 with eos-CMD (both men, aged 45 and 58 years) were treated with imatinib at a starting dose of 100 to 400 mg/day. Cytogenetic studies showed no evidence of either the bcr-abl translocation or t(5;12)(q33;p13) in any patient. Screening of exons encoding the intracellular catalytic domains and extracellular ligand binding domains of PDGFR beta (exons 2-23) and c-kit (exons 1-21) in 6 patients demonstrated mostly previously known polymorphisms. At a median follow-up of 17 weeks (range, 10-33 weeks), 2 patients with HES and 1 with eos-CMD have achieved complete clinical remission and 1 additional patient with HES has achieved a partial remission. In contrast to previous observations, all 4 responding patients had elevated serum interleukin-5 levels. Although the drug was well tolerated in most patients, a previously unrecognized treatment toxicity of acute left ventricular dysfunction occurred in a responding patient with HES within the first week of treatment. Myocardial biopsy revealed eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation, and the cardiogenic shock was reversed with the prompt institution of corticosteroid therapy."
False,furthermore ceftriaxone therapy meningitis induced strain rabbit model ineffectivenan,8451095,ceftriaxone,meningitis,"We recently managed an infant with meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in whom ceftriaxone failed to sterilize the cerebrospinal fluid after 6 days of therapy. This strain, which had a penicillin minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 micrograms/ml, appeared susceptible to ceftriaxone (MIC < 0.5 micrograms/ml) when evaluated by a commercial MIC panel (Microtech Medical Systems, Inc., Aurora, CO) but was found to have a ceftriaxone MIC of 4 micrograms/ml when evaluated by conventional microtiter broth dilution technique. Furthermore ceftriaxone therapy of meningitis induced with this strain in a rabbit model was ineffective. Thirteen of 112 pneumococcal strains (11.6%) isolated recently at Children's Medical Center of Dallas were penicillin-resistant, and 3 of these were highly penicillin-resistant (MIC > or = 2 micrograms/ml). The incidence of pneumococcal strains with cefotaxime MICs > or = 1.0 micrograms/ml has increased from 0 of 258 from 1981 to 1983 to 5 of 112 (4.5%) from 1991 to 1992. The definition of cephalosporin resistance for pneumococci requires modification and further studies of the antibiotic management of meningitis caused by such strains are needed because resistance to cephalosporins is increasing and the extended spectrum cephalosporins may be ineffective as sole therapy."

Teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, has a long plasma half-life which allows once-a-day bolus administration, making it a 'user friendly' agent. A randomized comparative evaluation of teicoplanin plus aztreonam versus gentamicin plus piperacillin in leukaemic patients with a clinical diagnosis of septicaemia was undertaken. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of teicoplanin and aztreonam in comparison to a 'standard antibiotic' regimen and (2) to assess the local and systemic tolerance of these drugs. Results of the study in more than 70 patients to date are presented, and the role of anti-Gram-positive antibiotics in the management of severe sepsis in immunocompromised patients is discussed."
True,however intakes animal foods total protein dietary cholesterol less plant derived carbohydrates predictors chd nan,15563444,carbohydrates,CHD,"Several nutrition and non-nutritional pathways are recognised in the development and occurrence of cardiovascular disease. In many populations, high intakes of saturated fat are associated with elevated serum cholesterol concentrations and increased coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. However, several studies report that hyperlipidaemia and heart diseases are not common among populations who consume coconut, a source of saturated fat. A case-control study was conducted among the Minangkabau known to be high coconut consumers to examine the difference in food patterns and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) between the coronary cases and their gender- and age-matched apparently healthy counterparts serving as controls. Eligible subjects with CHD were identified through the co-operation of five participating hospitals located in Padang and Bukittinggi in West Sumatra, Indonesia. A total of 93 eligible cases (62 men and 31 women) in the Case group and 189 subjects (113 men and 76 women) in the Control group were recruited. Information on the intakes of individual foods and dishes over the preceding 12 months was obtained using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The Case groups had significantly higher intakes of meats, eggs, sugar, tea, coffee and fruits, but lower intakes of soy products, rice and cereals compared to the controls. Coconut consumption as flesh or milk was not different between cases and controls. The cases had significantly higher intakes of protein and cholesterol, but lower intake of carbohydrate. Similar intakes of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids between the cases and controls indicated that the consumption of total fat or saturated fat, including that from coconut, was not a predictor for CHD in this food culture. However, the intakes of animal foods, total protein, dietary cholesterol and less plant derived carbohydrates were predictors of CHD."
True,summary half children treated vigabatrin demonstrated vfc abnormal ocular electrophysiological studiesnan,10894216,vigabatrin,VFC,"Vigabatrin is an anti-epileptic drug particularly useful for drug-resistant partial seizures and infantile spasms. Recently, vigabatrin-induced visual field constriction (VFC) and abnormal ocular electrophysiological studies were reported. In this study, we assessed visual fields, visual evoked potentials (VEPs), and electroretinography (ERG) in children treated with vigabatrin. Twenty-four visually asymptomatic children underwent a clinical ophthalmological examination, perimetry when appropriate, and VEP and ERG. Thirteen patients had at least one abnormal study. VFC was seen in 11 of 17 patients who had perimetry; 5 of 15 patients who underwent VEP testing and 4 of 11 who underwent ERG testing had abnormal examinations. For the most part, abnormal VEPs and ERGs were found in children who also had VFC. There was a consistent trend for longer treatment periods to correlate with VFC, abnormal ERGs, and VEPs. In summary, over half of the children treated with vigabatrin demonstrated VFC or abnormal ocular electrophysiological studies. Perimetry seemed to be the most sensitive modality for identifying vigabatrin toxicity. Abnormal ERGs and VEPs were primarily seen in children with VFC and may be useful in monitoring children who are not appropriate candidates for perimetry. Although the incidence of vigabatrin-induced VFC is worrisome, in the context of intractable seizures or infantile spasms, therapeutic benefits must be weighed against risks."

In vivo these substances significantly reduced the weight of neuroblastoma tumour transplants in the mice (nude/nude) (P less than 0.05). A dose/effect relationship could be established. In vitro, the D50 was determined, using fibroblasts as controls. The growth of neuroblastoma tumours was inhibited by different mechanisms: L-dopa and its metabolite dopamine reduced the activity of tyrosinase, BSO reduced glutathione levels, and L-dopa and tamoxifen raised cAMP concentrations."

Considering the lack of data regarding the genotoxic effects of these compounds in human cells, the objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, and expressions of the CASP3 and SOD1 genes in a cultured human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2 cells) treated with artemisinin and artesunate. We tested concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 μg/mL of both substances with a resazurin cytotoxicity assay, and the concentrations used in the genotoxicity experiments (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/mL) and gene expression analysis (5 μg/mL) were determined. The results of the comet assay in cells treated with artemisinin and artesunate showed a significant dose-dependent increase (P < 0.001) in the number of cells with DNA damage at all concentrations tested. However, the gene expression analysis revealed no significant change in expression of CASP3 or SOD1. Our data showed that although artemisinin and artesunate exhibited genotoxic effects in cultured HepG2 cells, they did not significantly alter expression of the CASP3 and SOD1 genes at the doses tested."
True,environmental impact associated resource depletion human toxicity mainly associated cobalt copper nickel thallium silver whereas ecotoxicity potential primarily associated cobalt copper nickel thallium silvernannickel chemical,23638841,nickel,toxicity,"Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-polymer (Li-poly) batteries have recently become dominant in consumer electronic products because of advantages associated with energy density and product longevity. However, the small size of these batteries, the high rate of disposal of consumer products in which they are used, and the lack of uniform regulatory policy on their disposal means that lithium batteries may contribute substantially to environmental pollution and adverse human health impacts due to potentially toxic materials. In this research, we used standardized leaching tests, life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and hazard assessment models to evaluate hazardous waste classification, resource depletion potential, and toxicity potentials of lithium batteries used in cellphones. Our results demonstrate that according to U.S. federal regulations, defunct Li-ion batteries are classified hazardous due to their lead (Pb) content (average 6.29 mg/L; σ = 11.1; limit 5). However, according to California regulations, all lithium batteries tested are classified hazardous due to excessive levels of cobalt (average 163,544 mg/kg; σ = 62,897; limit 8000), copper (average 98,694 mg/kg; σ = 28,734; limit 2500), and nickel (average 9525 mg/kg; σ = 11,438; limit 2000). In some of the Li-ion batteries, the leached concentrations of chromium, lead, and thallium exceeded the California regulation limits. The environmental impact associated with resource depletion and human toxicity is mainly associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver, whereas the ecotoxicity potential is primarily associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver. However, the relative contribution of aluminum and lithium to human toxicity and ecotoxicity could not be estimated due to insufficient toxicity data in the models. These findings support the need for stronger government policy at the local, national, and international levels to encourage recovery, recycling, and reuse of lithium battery materials."

The patients with refractory UC had been in remission due to LA (induction LA) in combination with the steroid therapy. They were then treated with LA once or twice a month for the purpose of maintaining remission (maintenance LA). The maintenance LA was performed by either a centrifuge method in 5 patients or a polyester adsorbent column method in 2 patients. Steroid dosage was gradually tapered as little as possible without recurrence based on clinical and/or colonoscopical judgments. Four patients were maintained in remission without steroids over 12 months. Recurrence was observed in 3 patients at 3, 3, and 6 months after the beginning of the maintenance LA, respectively. Two of the 3 patients were again conducted to remission by the second induction LA and maintained in remission by the second maintenance LA. Two patients finally underwent total colectomy because of recurrence of UC in a severe form. It is concluded that the maintenance LA therapy might be effective in some patients with steroid dependent or resistant UC for the maintenance of remission without steroids."

False,conjugated linoleic acid inhibits growth number human cancer cell lines suppresses chemicallyinduced tumor development number sites animal modelsnan,10386321,linoleic acid,tumor/cancer,"Prevention is an important strategy for conquering cancer. Milk fat contains a number of components, such as conjugated linoleic acid, sphingomyelin, butyric acid, ether lipids, beta-carotene, and vitamins A and D that have anticancer potential. Conjugated linoleic acid inhibits the growth of a number of human cancer cell lines and suppresses chemically-induced tumor development at a number of sites in animal models. As little as 0.1% of dietary conjugated linoleic acid inhibits the development of rat mammary tumors, independent of the amount and type of fat in the diet. Sphingomyelin, through its metabolites ceramide and sphingosine, participates in multiple antiproliferative pathways associated with suppression of carcinogenesis. Dietary sphingomyelin inhibits murine colon tumor development. Butyric acid, uniquely present in ruminant milk, is a potent antineoplastic agent and may ameliorate its potency through synergy with other milk fat components. Dietary butyric acid inhibits mammary carcinoma development in rats. In humans, ether lipids, beta-carotene, and vitamins A and D are associated with anticancer effects. Cows have the ability to extract anticarcinogenic components from pasture and feed and transfer them to milk. Use of genetic engineering and other techniques to increase the range and level of anticarcinogens in pasture and supplements may increase the anticancer potential of milk."

Adipose tissues produce a number of adipokines and cytokines, which affect endothelial and metabolic function resulting in insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (risks factors for CVD). Both ED and metabolic syndrome improve with a reduction in body mass index (BMI). The relationships among obesity, metabolic syndrome, ED, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and serum total and free testosterone levels are complex and often confusing to the physician. It is known that BMI is inversely proportional to serum total testosterone concentrations; low serum SHBG levels in obesity contribute to the low serum total testosterone. Recent studies show that BMI is also inversely proportional to free testosterone concentration. The characteristic low serum testosterone concentrations observed in obese men are also present in men with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. A small proportion of men with ED have hypogonadism; however, the proportion increases if these men are obese with manifestations of the metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus. ED is a common symptom in patients with type 2 diabetes who also have low testosterone levels. This review describes the relationships between low serum testosterone concentrations and ED in obese patients and those with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus."

To this, 45 stable state III COPD patients were recruited and reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidised glutathione (GSSG) in erythrocytes and thiol proteins (P-SH) and carbonyl proteins (PC) in both erythrocytes and plasma were evaluated. All COPD patients underwent 2 l/m oxygen for 18 h and NAC at 1200 or 1800 mg/day or placebo for 48 h starting with oxygen administration. Blood samples were collected at basal conditions, after 8 and 18 h of oxygen administration and 24 h after oxygen withdrawal."

True,urinary catecholamines hyperthermiarelated deaths nan,2279717,catecholamines,deaths,"A group of five hyperthermia-related deaths is presented in which urinary noradrenaline (NA) concentrations were elevated (172.1 +/- 119.4 ng/ml) compared with a control group of rapid violent deaths (43.7 +/- 26.1 ng/ml). Urinary adrenaline (A) concentrations were not elevated in the hyperthermia cases, nor were there any significant differences in urinary dopamine (DA) concentrations between the two groups. All except one of the hyperthermia victims were under the influence of ethanol. It is suggested that a combination of heat stress and ethanol consumption was responsible for the elevated urinary NA in the hyperthermia cases, reflecting increased sympathetic nervous system activity. A combination of high urinary NA with low A seems to be characteristic of hyperthermia fatalities, in contrast to hypothermia deaths, where both NA and A are usually elevated."

Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with NMS, atypical antipsychotic drugs like ziprasidone may also be a cause. The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia who developed signs and symptoms of NMS after 2 days of treatment with an 80-mg/day dose of orally administrated ziprasidone. This case is the earliest (second day of treatment) NMS due to ziprasidone reported in the literature."
True,ptu associated vasculitis girl turner syndrome graves diseasenan,16418614,PTU,vasculitis,"Palpable purpura is a concerning clinical finding in pediatric patients and can have many causes, including infectious and autoimmune processes. A rare cause, drug-induced vasculitis, may result from the production of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) in response to a medication. We report a girl with Turner syndrome and Graves' disease who presented with palpable purpuric lesions. The diagnosis of propylthiouracil (PTU)-associated vasculitis was made by observation of consistent clinical features, the detection of elevated ANA and ANCA in the blood, and the observed clinical resolution of symptoms following withdrawal of PTU. Subsequent treatment of persistent hyperthyroidism with radioablation did not result in an exacerbation of the vasculitis, a complication described in prior case reports."
True,alcohol drinking history fatal injury older adults nan,17418699,Alcohol,injury in older adults,"Although most clinical guidelines for older adults allow for one drink a day in persons without a history of alcoholism, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease, alcohol may contribute to fatal injury in the elderly. Using two national surveys, this case-control study determined the associations between drinking history and fatal injuries from falls, motor vehicle crashes and suicides. We performed a case-control study using 1,735 cases who died of falls, motor vehicle crashes, or suicides selected from the 1993 National Mortality Follow-Back Survey; controls (n=13,381) were a representative sample of the U.S. population from the 1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey. Cases and controls were restricted to ages 55 years and older. Having 12 or more drinks in the year before death or interview for the controls was used to assess alcohol-drinking history. The unadjusted relative odds for drinkers versus nondrinkers for falls, motor vehicle crashes, and suicides were 1.7, 1.7, and 1.6, respectively. Adjustment for age, gender, marital status, education, and working in the last year did not change these effect estimates, which all excluded the null value. Drinking increased the risk of suicide more for women than for men. Drinking history in older adults is associated about equally with an increased risk of fatal injury from falls, motor vehicle crashes, and suicides."
True,trials also indicate increased frequencies meconium passage neonatal acidemia cesarean delivery fetal distress women receiving higher doses misoprostol nan,10454679,misoprostol,fetal distress,"Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E(1 ) analog, is widely used in the United States for cervical ripening and labor induction. Its use for these indications is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved indication in the product labeling is the treatment and prevention of intestinal ulcer disease resulting from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use. Multiple trials have proved that misoprostol is an effective agent for cervical ripening and labor induction in term pregnancy; however, investigations continue regarding the optimal dose, dosing regimen, and route of administration. Uterine contraction abnormalities are often found in association with higher misoprostol doses. Some trials also indicate increased frequencies of meconium passage, neonatal acidemia, and cesarean delivery for fetal distress in women receiving higher doses of misoprostol. Overall, most trials fail to demonstrate a significant change in the cesarean delivery rate with the use of this agent. Misoprostol is an effective agent for cervical ripening and labor induction when used in a judicious and cautious fashion."
True,third patient use warfarin three weeks initially increased frequency intensity cluster headache attacks subsequently induced prolonged remissionnan,16362716,warfarin,cluster headache,"Chronic cluster headache remains refractory to medical therapy in at least 30% of those who suffer from this condition. The lack of alternative medical therapies that are as effective as, or more effective than, lithium carbonate makes new therapies necessary for this highly disabling condition. Based on a previous report, we gave oral anticoagulants to three patients with chronic cluster headache. Two of them remained cluster headache-free while taking warfarin. In the third patient, the use of warfarin for three weeks initially increased the frequency and intensity of cluster headache attacks but subsequently induced a prolonged remission. In spite of the paucity of data available, oral anticoagulation appears to be a promising therapy for chronic cluster headache."

True,report case hypotension bradycardia asystole intravenous administration highdose methylprednisolone yearold patient underwent electrocardiographic ecg monitoring throughout episodenan,10074612,methylprednisolone,bradycardia,"We report a case of hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole after intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone in a 73-year-old patient who underwent electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring throughout the episode. There was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earlier. The patient was admitted with a pulmonary-renal syndrome with hemoptysis, rapidly progressive renal failure, and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient recovered cardiac rhythm. The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia. This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP). These mechanisms are not well understood because, in most cases, the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event. Rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here, and the authors discount ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism."
False,patients however primarily advanced disease either refractory imatinib eventually relapsenan,15215876,imatinib,advanced disease,"Imatinib is a molecularly targeted therapy that inhibits the oncogenic fusion protein BCR-ABL, the tyrosine kinase involved in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Selective inhibition of BCR-ABL activity by imatinib has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of CML, particularly in chronic phase. Some patients, however, primarily those with advanced disease, are either refractory to imatinib or eventually relapse. Relapse with imatinib frequently depends not only on re-emergence of BCR-ABL kinase activity but may also indicate BCR-ABL-independent disease progression not amenable to imatinib inhibition. Results from phase 2/3 trials suggest that rates of resistance and relapse correlate with the stage of disease and with the monitoring parameters--hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular response. These observations and more recent trials with imatinib, combined with insights provided by an increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of resistance, have established the rationale for strategies to avoid and overcome imatinib resistance in the management of CML patients. To prevent resistance, early diagnosis and prompt treatment with appropriate initial dosing is essential. Management of resistance may include therapeutic strategies such as dose escalation to achieve individual optimal levels, combination therapy, as well as treatment interruption."
False,efficacy ccb amlodipine arb valsartan lowering bp protecting cardiovascular events stroke across range hypertensive patient populations established many yearsnan,20626210,amlodipine,cardiovascular events,"Early initiation of rational and effective combination therapy consisting of antihypertensive drugs with two different and complementary mechanisms of actions is increasingly becoming accepted in clinical practice and by guidelines as a first-line approach to control blood pressure (BP) and prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Once-daily combination therapy provides more rapid control of BP, which is important for preventing cardiovascular events, with similar or improved tolerability compared with the component monotherapies, and improved adherence because of regimen simplification. Combination therapy with a calcium channel antagonist (calcium channel blocker [CCB]) and an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a rational approach to achieve BP goals and provide protection against renal and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A number of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations, including CCB/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and CCB/ angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) combinations are available as fixed-dose formulations. There is substantial evidence for the BP-lowering efficacy of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations in diverse patient populations, and their use in combination is associated with favourable tolerability and fewer adverse metabolic effects than some other combination therapies. Recent evidence from large outcome trials supports the use of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations for reducing the risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly in high-risk patients, together with evidence that the benefits of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations may extend beyond their efficacy in lowering BP in terms of protecting against fatal and nonfatal stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related deaths. The efficacy of the CCB amlodipine and the ARB valsartan in lowering BP and protecting against cardiovascular events and stroke across a range of hypertensive patient populations has been established over many years. Fixed-dose amlodipine/valsartan combinations are available in many countries and have shown greater BP reductions and better BP control than the respective monotherapies in diverse patient populations, together with a favourable tolerability profile. Once-daily amlodipine/valsartan is a rational and convenient treatment option for the effective management of patients with hypertension, improving adherence to antihypertensive medication and protecting against cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality."

All chlamydial species have a tendency to cause persistent infections, which have been associated to several chronic diseases including blinding trachoma, infertility and coronary heart disease (CHD). At present, no efficient treatment for the eradication of chronic chlamydial infections exists and, thus, new antichlamydial compounds are urgently needed. This study was designed to screen antichlamydial activity of natural flavonoids and other natural and structurally similar synthetic compounds against Chlamydia pneumoniae in human cell line (HL). HL cells were infected with C. pneumoniae and incubated 72 h with studied compounds. Reduction in the number of inclusions was determined with immunofluorescence staining. In vitro minimum inhibitory concentration was also determined for some of the most active compounds. Thirty seven percentage of the studied compounds (57 in total) were highly active against C. pneumoniae and all the studied compounds were non-toxic to the host cells at studied concentrations. Our study revealed direct antichlamydial effect for selected polyphenolic compounds against C. pneumoniae, in vitro. We also demonstrated the ability of some of the investigated compounds to accumulate inside cells or into cell membranes and cause inhibition, even when present only prior to infection."

Based on empirical drug limitations about 10-15% of patients will develop congestive heart failure (CHF) with a mortality of -50% within 2 years on digitalo-diuretic therapy alone. To avoid CHF there is a consensus recommendation that cardiac function should be monitored in close connection with anthracycline administration. As no prospective studies in a larger series have been performed, these recommendations are based on retrospective data on small numbers of patients."

False,combined therapy effective dfo removing preventing liver spleen bone marrow iron accumulation beta-thalassemic patientsnan,20113293,iron,beta-thalassemic,"We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare the effect of iron chelation on liver, spleen and bone marrow. We examined 21 beta-thalassemic patients undergoing deferoxamine (DFO) (9/21) or combined therapy [DFO and deferiprone (L1), 12/21] with two abdominal MRI studies using T1-w/Pd-w/T2*-wGRE and T1-wTSE sequences. Changes in serum ferritin (DF%), and liver, spleen and marrow to paraspinous muscles signal intensity ratios (SI) in T1-wTSE sequence were calculated as D%=[(2(nd)value-1(st) value)/1(st) value] x100%. Negative DF% and positive D(SI)% indicated reduction of iron. Although 17/21 (80.9%) patients demonstrated reduction in ferritin, only 8/21 (38%), 7/21 (33.3%) and 7/21 (33.3%) patients had decreased liver, spleen and marrow iron. Patients undergoing combined therapy showed significantly greater reduction (Student's t-test, p < 0.05) or less increase (t-test, p <0.05) in iron stores. Combined therapy is more effective than DFO for removing and preventing liver, spleen and bone marrow iron accumulation in beta-thalassemic patients. Magnetic resonance imaging is valuable for organ-specific monitoring of chelation therapy."
True,microtubule inhibitor mtibased chemotherapies used treatment breast cancerincluding vinca alkaloids taxanes epothilonesare known associated peripheral neuropathy nan,18567992,vinca alkaloids,peripheral neuropathy,"Microtubule inhibitor (MTI)-based chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer--including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones--are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone."
True,chart review potential features myocarditis pericarditis cardiomyopathy children adolescents treated clozapine nan,15319023,clozapine,pericarditis,"Clozapine is known to cause cardiac side effects, including myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy. Prompted by a case of clozapine-related pericarditis in an adolescent, we undertook a retrospective chart review to discover whether any unrecognized cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy were among the children, adolescents, and young adults we had treated with clozapine. The sample comprised a total of 36 patients, who were monitored regularly over a period ranging from 2.5 to 79 months. The average observation period was 7.5 months. Patients were assessed for potential indicators of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. In more than 66% of all patients, at least one of several parameters potentially indicative of pericarditis, myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy was abnormal in at least one instance during the observation period. In all cases in which abnormalities were discovered, the abnormalities were found to be unspecific for myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. With the exception of the case which prompted our study, none of the patients were found to have developed any such disorder in the course of further treatment with clozapine."

After a 14-day wash-out and a 14-day placebo run-in period, therapy was initiated with verapamil 180 mg plus trandolapril 2 mg. At monthly visits, if mean daytime diastolic BP remained > or = 90 mmHg, the dose combination was uptitrated stepwise to verapamil 240 mg plus trandolapril 4 mg, verapamil 360 mg plus trandolapril 4 mg, and finally hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg were added. Mean 24-hour BP dropped from 150 +/- 14/96 +/- 7 mmHg at baseline to 131 +/- 13/82 +/- 8 mmHg after 4 months treatment (p < 0.001). In 16 (76%) patients mean 24-hour diastolic BP was < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial and 15 (71%) patients achieved a reduction of > 10 mmHg. Five out of 5 patients finishing on dose I were controlled, 5/6 patients on dose II, 5/8 patients on dose III, and 1/2 patients who received additional hydrochlorothiazide. The 24-hour BP load fell from 72 +/- 8% at baseline to 35 +/- 25% in 4 months (p < 0.001). Mean diastolic BP drop for the 2 peak hours during daytime was 20 mmHg and for the last 2 hours of monitoring was 13 mmHg, resulting in a trough to peak ratio of 65%. There were no significant adverse events or biochemical abnormalities. It is concluded that the combination doses tested showed a sustained and marked antihypertensive effect throughout the 24-hour dosing interval, and the starting dose (verapamil 180 mg plus trandolapril 2 mg) seems appropriate in this group of patients."

The trial is single-blind. 23 582 patient-years of observation have been completed so far, 10 684 on active drugs and 12 898 on placebos. The results show an association between bendrofluazide treatment and impotence, and impotence also occurred more frequently in patients taking propranolol than in those taking placebos. Other adverse reactions significantly linked with active drugs include impaired glucose tolerance in men and women and gout in men, associated with bendrofluazide treatment, and Raynaud's phenomenon and dyspnoea in men and women taking propranolol. No corneal disease is known to have occurred in the propranolol group. Mean serum potassium level fell, and urea and uric acid levels rose, in men and women taking bendrofluazide. In the propranolol group, serum potassium and uric acid levels rose in both sexes, but the urea level rose significantly in women only."

True,dizziness nausea nin unsteadiness also depended nicotine dosage nicotine blood concentration better predictor temporal dependence nystagmus nicotine dosagenan,17990061,nicotine,nausea,"Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."

True,investigated whether endothelial cells infected sinv differentially responsive bradykinin bk potent inducer inflammatory edema broad range infectious diseasesnan,22047990,bradykinin,inflammatory edema,"Sindbis virus (SINV) induces inflammatory and vasoactive responses that are associated with rash and arthritis in human infections. The mechanisms underlying infection-associated microvasculopathy are still unknown. We investigated whether endothelial cells infected by SINV are differentially responsive to bradykinin (BK), a potent inducer of inflammatory edema in a broad range of infectious diseases. Human endothelial cells (HBMECs) infected with SINV presented an upregulation of bradykinin B2 receptors (BK2R) expression. Also, BK reduced SINV-induced apoptosis and enhanced virus replication in HBMECs in a way dependent on BK2R, PI3 kinase and ERK signaling. Strikingly, intracerebral infection of mice in the presence of a BK2R antagonist reduced the local viral load. Our data suggest that SINV infection renders human endothelial cells hypersensitive to BK, which increases host cell survival and viral replication. Ongoing studies may clarify if the deregulation of the kinin pathway contributes to infection-associated vasculopathies in life-threatening arbovirus infections."

True,usually low dose asa related ulcers reasonably small asymptomatic probably heal period weeks monthsnan,22542152,ASA,ulcers,"Low dose aspirin (ASA) use has been associated with a wide range of adverse side effects in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which range from troublesome symptoms without mucosal lesions to more serious toxicity, including ulcers, GI bleeding, perforation and even death. Upper GI symptoms in low dose ASA users are common but often careless or misinterpreted and they are not always related to the presence of mucosal injury. Usually, low dose ASA related ulcers are reasonably small and asymptomatic, and probably heal over a period of weeks to a few months. But, the real clinical problem occurs when the ulcer results in a GI complication (mostly bleeding). The estimated average excess risk of symptomatic or complicated ulcer related to low dose ASA is five cases per 1000 ASA users per year. Death is the worst outcome of GI complications in low dose ASA users, but data about this aspect are scarce. Current evidence indicates that low dose ASA can damage the lower GI tract also, but the real size of the problem is still unknown."
False,clinical point view delta thc produces therapeutic benefits beyond reasonable doubtnan,15302527,Delta(9)-THC,THC,"This review analyses the therapeutic usefulness of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and its potential to induce adverse reactions on humans. During the last 30 years an enormous amount of research was carried out resulting in the disclosure of the cannabinoid system in Central Nervous System, with its CB(1) and CB(2) receptors, and the agonist anandamide. Under the clinical point of view, Delta(9)-THC produces some therapeutic benefits which are beyond reasonable doubt. Thus, the effects on nausea/emesis due to cancer chemotherapy, as appetite promoter, on some painful conditions and on symptoms of multiple sclerosis are clearly demonstrated. Delta(9)-THC is not devoid of ill effects. On the cognitive domain it impairs the human capacity to discriminate time intervals and space distances, vigilance, memory and the performance for mental work. On the psychic area Delta(9)-THC may induce unpleasant reactions such as disconnected thoughts, panic reactions, disturbing changes in perception, delusions and hallucinatory experiences. However, the long term effects on the psyche and cognition are not known as there are no reports of prolonged use of Delta(9)-THC. Actually, it has been proposed by WHO that Delta(9)-THC should be rescheduled to schedule IV of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Drugs, as it does not constitute a substantial risk to public health and its abuse is rare if at all."
True,therapeutic review ascorbic acid value chromium poisoning chromium dermatitisnan,10382555,chromium,poisoning,"Repeated topical exposure to chromium(VI) may cause an allergic contact dermatitis or the formation of chrome ulcers. Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III)."
False,study examined possible interactions synthetic vitamin analogue cb1093 two known mediators apoptosis tnfalpha ceramide mcf td hst breast cancer cellsnan,11165041,CB1093,breast cancer,"Mechanisms by which vitamin D analogues promote apoptosis in tumour cells are unclear. In this study we have examined possible interactions between the synthetic vitamin D analogue CB1093 and two other known mediators of apoptosis, TNFalpha and ceramide, in MCF-7, T47D and Hs578T breast cancer cells. These studies indicated that cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) is involved in CB1093 as well as TNFalpha-mediated cell death. CB1093 promoted both TNFalpha and ceramide-induced c-PLA(2) activation, which was inversely related to loss of cell viability in MCF-7 and Hs578T cells. TNFalpha alone (5-20 ng/ml) failed to induce cytotoxicity and activation of cPLA(2) in T47D cells. However, pretreatment of these cells with CB1093 potentiated C(2)-ceramide-induced cPLA(2) activation and cell death. Treatment with CB1093 alone induced loss of cell viability and DNA fragmentation in all three cell lines by 5 days and these effects were accompanied by activation of cPLA(2). Furthermore, co-treatment with the cPLA(2) inhibitor AACOCF(3) led to partial protection against loss of cell viability induced by CB1093 in Hs578T and T47D cells as well as MCF-7 cells. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk prevented TNFalpha but not C(2)-ceramide and CB1093-mediated release of arachidonic acid and cell death in MCF-7 cells. These results indicate that CB1093 potentiates responsiveness of breast cancer cells to TNFalpha and suggest that ceramide and/or cPLA(2) might be involved as downstream effectors in vitamin D-mediated caspase-independent cell death."
True,thus continuing search strategies minimize csa toxicity maintain adequate immunosuppressionnan,15041316,CsA,toxicity,"The introduction of cyclosporine (CsA) into clinical practice resulted in a dramatic reduction in the incidence and severity of acute rejection. As a result, short-term and medium-term kidney allograft survival increased greatly. However, the long-term patient and graft survival have not improved to a similar degree. This can partly be attributed to the side effects of CsA and partly to the fact that the use of CsA has not led to a reduced incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy. Thus, there has been a continuing search for strategies that minimize CsA toxicity but maintain adequate immunosuppression. This has resulted in the development of the CsA microemulsion formulation and improved methods for therapeutic drug monitoring. With the introduction of newer immunosuppressive drugs, early CsA withdrawal and CsA-free immunosuppressive therapy have become feasible. However, CsA weaning or complete avoidance is associated with a slightly higher risk of acute rejection, and the long-term efficacy and safety of such strategies remain to be established. Therefore, it is to be expected that in the near future CsA will remain part of the standard immunosuppressive regimen in many transplant centers."

False,addition low toxicity gossypol thioderivatives reversed nitric oxide donors physiological medianan,12670651,nitric oxide,toxicity,"New dithiane or dithiolane derivatives of gossypol and gossypolone were synthesized with dithiolethane or dithiolpropane in the presence of BF(3)/Et(2)O. These thioderivatives exhibited low toxicity on KB cells (human epidermoid carcinoma cells of the mouth). They react easily with electrophiles in aprotic solvents to regenerate gossypolone or to form dehydrogossypoldithianes and dehydrogossypoldithiolanes, which display higher toxicity on KB cells. In addition, the low toxicity of gossypol thioderivatives was reversed by nitric oxide donors in physiological media. These experiments suggest that gossypol and gossypolone dithianes and dithiolanes can be used as prodrugs that target tumor cells surrounded by high concentrations of nitric oxide."
False,results support major role free radical generation adr toxicity well suggesting mitochondria critical site cardiac injury nan,8787689,ADR,cardiac injury,"Adriamycin (ADR) is a potent anticancer drug known to cause severe cardiac toxicity. Although ADR generates free radicals, the role of free radicals in the development of cardiac toxicity and the intracellular target for ADR-induced cardiac toxicity are still not well understood. We produced three transgenic mice lines expressing increased levels of human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial enzyme, as an animal model to investigate the role of ADR-mediated free radical generation in mitochondria. The human MnSOD was expressed, functionally active, and properly transported into mitochondria in the heart of transgenic mice. The levels of copper-zinc SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase did not change in the transgenic mice. Electron microscopy revealed dose-dependent ultrastructural alterations with marked mitochondrial damage in nontransgenic mice treated with ADR, but not in the transgenic littermates. Biochemical analysis indicated that the levels of serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in ADR-treated mice were significantly greater in nontransgenic than their transgenic littermates expressing a high level of human MnSOD after ADR treatment. These results support a major role for free radical generation in ADR toxicity as well as suggesting mitochondria as the critical site of cardiac injury."
False,influence uv irradiation vitamin metabolism children chronic renal diseases nan,8175280,vitamin D,chronic renal diseases,"The aim of this study was to find out whether an improvement of vitamin D metabolism and its metabolites and a decrease of parathormones can be reached through a diet and UV irradiation. Forty-eight children with kidney insufficiency were divided into four groups: Group 1--diet according to Bergström with EAA and cetoanalogue supplementation plus UV therapy; Group 2--diet plus EAA and cetoanalogue supplementation without UV therapy; Group 3--without diet and supplementation of EAA and ceto but with UV therapy; Group 4--without any diet and without UV therapy. The average levels of kidney insufficiency in all children at the stage of a manifest kidney insufficiency were not significantly different. As a result it became obvious that children exposed to UV irradiation with or without a diet had better post-treatment values and that children with kidney insufficiency reacted to UV therapy plus diet best of all. One can obtain the same results also by oral vitamin D therapy, although we have to point out the danger of calcinosis and stone formation which the author could frequently demonstrate, but never after UV treatment."
False,methotrexate mtx sulfasalazine ssz cyclosporine csa widely used dmards treatment psa safe effective patients active peripheral arthritis although appear effective axial manifestationsnan,12463452,CsA/cyclosporine,arthritis,"As erosive and deforming arthritis is present in 40% of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), early and aggressive treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be as effective in controlling the progression of the disease as it is for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), and cyclosporine (CsA) are the most widely used DMARDs in the treatment of PsA and are safe and effective in patients with active peripheral arthritis, although they do not appear to be effective on axial manifestations. No controlled study has evaluated the efficacy of these drugs on the progression of radiological damage. It has recently been demonstrated that leflunomide and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are effective in PsA and psoriasis. The symptomatic improvement has been important and sustained and side effects minimal. In particular, inhibitors of TNF appear to have excellent potential to treat PsA. These agents are able to slow joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis and they are effective on spinal symptoms in ankylosing spondylitis. Hopefully, these findings will prove true in PsA as well."
True,possibility habitual use acetaminophen alone increases risk esrd clearly demonstrated cannot dismissedsentence says known whether acetaminophen causes esrd also impossible therefore know whether acetaminophen causes esrd therefore answer sentence say acetaminophen contributes causes esrd,8669433,acetaminophen,ESRD,"Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of phenacetin is associated with the development of chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19. As a result of these and other studies, phenacetin has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries. However, three case control studies, one each in North Carolina, northern Maryland, and West Berlin, Germany, showed that habitual use of acetaminophen is also associated with chronic renal failure and ESRD, with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4. These studies suggest that both phenacetin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of ESRD, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former. This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in nephrotoxic potential of the drugs themselves. A lower relative risk would be expected for acetaminophen if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone. Thus, acetaminophen has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics, whereas phenacetin was available only in combinations. The possibility that habitual use of acetaminophen alone increases the risk of ESRD has not been clearly demonstrated, but cannot be dismissed."

Teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, has a long plasma half-life which allows once-a-day bolus administration, making it a 'user friendly' agent. A randomized comparative evaluation of teicoplanin plus aztreonam versus gentamicin plus piperacillin in leukaemic patients with a clinical diagnosis of septicaemia was undertaken. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of teicoplanin and aztreonam in comparison to a 'standard antibiotic' regimen and (2) to assess the local and systemic tolerance of these drugs. Results of the study in more than 70 patients to date are presented, and the role of anti-Gram-positive antibiotics in the management of severe sepsis in immunocompromised patients is discussed."

The effect of variation in hepatic artery anatomy on tumour response to regional floxuridine (FUdR) was studied. Aberrant hepatic arterial anatomy occurred in 13 of 74 patients (18 per cent) who underwent cannulation of the hepatic artery and infusion of FUdR for colorectal liver metastases. The non-dominant hepatic artery was ligated and the dominant artery cannulated in those with aberrant anatomy. Despite evidence of a collateral circulation to the non-dominant area of the liver in these patients, there was no significant reduction in median tumour volume with treatment (before treatment 214 ml, after treatment 339 ml). By contrast, there was a significant (P < 0.001) decrease in median tumour volume (before treatment 329 ml, after treatment 148 ml) in those with normal anatomy. Delivery of FUdR to metastases via an intrahepatic collateral circulation was not as effective as through a main hepatic artery."

False,effects calciumentry blocker nicardipine intrarenal hemodynamics studied essential hypertension nan,1986570,nicardipine,hypertension,"The effects of a calcium-entry blocker, nicardipine, on intrarenal hemodynamics were studied in essential hypertension. A 4-week study was performed in eight patients with essential hypertension who were given a regular sodium diet in the first and third weeks, and a sodium-restricted diet in the second and fourth weeks. Nicardipine, 60 mg/d, was administered in the third and fourth weeks. The urinary sodium excretion rate (UNaV) was plotted on the y-axis against the mean arterial pressure (MAP) on the x-axis before and after the administration of nicardipine. Assuming the difference between MAP and the x-intercept of this renal function curve represents the effective filtration pressure across the glomerular capillaries, the intrarenal hemodynamics such as afferent arteriolar resistance (RA) and efferent arteriolar resistances (RE), glomerular pressure (PG), and gross filtration coefficient (KFG) were calculated. Although the MAP on regular salt diet was lowered from 125 +/- 3 to 109 +/- 2 mm Hg by nicardipine, neither the renal blood flow rate (RBF) (670 +/- 40 mL/min) nor the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (79 +/- 2 mL/min) was altered. The RA was estimated to be reduced from 9,300 +/- 900 to 7,400 +/- 700 dyne.s.cm-5 (P less than 0.01), while no changes were noted in RE (4,900 +/- 400 dyne.s.cm-5), PG (50 +/- 1 mm Hg), or KFG (0.180 +/- 0.041 [mL/s]/mm Hg). Essential hypertension has been characterized by a prominent increase in RA, resulting in maintenance of normal PG. This Ca-entry blocker worked to normalize intrarenal hemodynamics in essential hypertension by dilating afferent arterioles alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
True,gastrointestinal lesions complications lowdose aspirin gastrointestinal tractnan,22542152,aspirin,Gastrointestinal lesions,"Low dose aspirin (ASA) use has been associated with a wide range of adverse side effects in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which range from troublesome symptoms without mucosal lesions to more serious toxicity, including ulcers, GI bleeding, perforation and even death. Upper GI symptoms in low dose ASA users are common but often careless or misinterpreted and they are not always related to the presence of mucosal injury. Usually, low dose ASA related ulcers are reasonably small and asymptomatic, and probably heal over a period of weeks to a few months. But, the real clinical problem occurs when the ulcer results in a GI complication (mostly bleeding). The estimated average excess risk of symptomatic or complicated ulcer related to low dose ASA is five cases per 1000 ASA users per year. Death is the worst outcome of GI complications in low dose ASA users, but data about this aspect are scarce. Current evidence indicates that low dose ASA can damage the lower GI tract also, but the real size of the problem is still unknown."

Twelve women meeting prospective, DSM-IV criteria for PMDD, five of whom had a history of sexual abuse, participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design study, comparing 2 months of on oral clonidine (0.3 mg/day) with 2 months on active placebo. During the luteal phase that preceded randomization and following each two-month challenge, women were tested for cardiovascular measures at rest and in response to mental stress, and for resting plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations as well as beta1 and beta2-AR responsivity using the isoproterenol sensitivity test. Results revealed that in comparison to placebo, clonidine significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine concentrations, increased both beta1- and beta2-AR responsivity, and reduced resting and stress heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) (p < 0.05) in all PMDD women. With clonidine, sexually abused PMDD women exhibited greater decreases in resting and stress-induced HR (p < 0.01) and stress-induced systolic BP (p < 0.05), while non-abused PMDD women exhibited greater reductions in plasma NE concentration (p = 0.07), and greater increases in beta2-AR responsivity (p < 0.05) than abused PMDD women. These results suggest PMDD women with and without a history of sexual abuse respond differently to a clonidine challenge in measures reflecting autonomic nervous system functioning, indicating that abuse may modify presynaptic alpha2-AR function in PMDD."

False,demonstrate molecular mechanism inhibitory action apigenin androgen refractory human prostate carcinoma du cells mutations tumor suppressor gene prbnan,14750216,androgen,tumor,"Development of effective agents for treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer has become a national medical priority. We have reported recently that apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone), found in many common fruits and vegetables, has shown remarkable effects in inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis in many human prostate carcinoma cells. Here we demonstrate the molecular mechanism of inhibitory action of apigenin on androgen-refractory human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells that have mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 and pRb. Treatment of cells with apigenin resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of growth, colony formation, and G1 phase arrest of the cell cycle. This effect was associated with a marked decrease in the protein expression of cyclin D1, D2, and E and their activating partner, cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)2, 4, and 6, with concomitant upregulation of WAF1/p21, KIP1/p27, INK4a/p16, and INK4c/p18. The induction of WAF1/p21 and its growth inhibitory effects by apigenin appears to be independent of p53 and pRb status of these cells. Apigenin treatment also resulted in alteration in Bax/Bcl2 ratio in favor of apoptosis, which was associated with the release of cytochrome c and induction of apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1). This effect was found to result in a significant increase in cleaved fragments of caspase-9, -3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Further, apigenin treatment resulted in downmodulation of the constitutive expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)/p65 and NF-kappaB/p50 in the nuclear fraction that correlated with an increase in the expression of IkappaB-alpha (IkappaBalpha) in the cytosol. Taken together, we concluded that molecular mechanisms during apigenin-mediated growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in DU145 cells was due to (1) modulation in cell-cycle machinery, (2) disruption of mitochondrial function, and (3) NF-kappaB inhibition."
True,coinjection melanoma cells 12(s)-hete increased lung homing activity bf melanoma cellsnan,23664097,12(S)-HETE,melanoma,"12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) is a non-haeme iron-containing dioxygenase that forms 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) or 15(S)-HETE. Several biological mediators including cytokines, growth factors and lipid metabolites released during tumour cell-endothelial cell adhesion are associated with malignant tumour progression. Here we found that HETEs released from the host organ played a critical role in tumour metastasis. Intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma cells caused lung nodule formation, which was markedly attenuated in 12/15-LOX null mice. Co-injection of melanoma cells with 12(S)-HETE increased the lung homing activity of B16F10 melanoma cells. In vitro studies showed that 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent increase of adhesion of B16F10 cells on collagen or fibronectin. The melanoma cell adhesion was then evaluated in pulmonary primary cell culture isolated from wild-type (WT) and 12/15-LOX knockout (KO) mice. It was found that the adhesion of melanoma cells on the epithelial cells isolated from 12/15-LOX null mice was reduced in comparison with those isolated from WT mice. Treatment of 12(S)-HETE increased the pFAK in melanoma cells adhering on collagen-coated slide. The enhancement of adherence elicited by 12(S)-HETE in B16F10 cells could be antagonised by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor 14 (FAK inhibitor) or PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor). 12(S)-HETE increased the phosphorylation of FAK and ERK in adhering melanoma cells. The FAK phosphorylation induced by 12(S)-HETE was further inhibited by PD98059, indicating that FAK is the downstream target of ERK. The adhesion and lung metastasis of human melanoma cells of C32 in NOD/SCID mice were also potentiated by co-treatment with 12(S)-HETE. These results demonstrate that 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE activates ERK and FAK signalling pathways, thereby upregulates the adhesion and metastatic potential of melanoma cells. The endogenous release of 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE in the host organ may affect the metastatic potential of melanoma. "
False,graftversushost disease prophylaxis comprised continuous infusion calcineurin inhibitor without mycophenolate mofetil nan,19709082,mycophenolate mofetil,Graft-versus-host disease,"Umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT) is widely accepted, but one critical issue for adult patients is a low engraftment rate, of which one cause is haemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). We aimed to identify the contribution of HPS to engraftment failure after CBT, following preparative regimens containing fludarabine phosphate, in 119 patients (median age, 55 years; range; 17-69 years) with haematological diseases. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis comprised continuous infusion of a calcineurin inhibitor with or without mycophenolate mofetil. Of the 119 patients, 20 developed HPS within a median of 15 d (cumulative incidence; 16.8%) and 17 of them did so before engraftment. Donor-dominant chimaerism was confirmed in 16 of 18 evaluable patients with HPS. Despite aggressive interventions including corticosteroid, ciclosporin, high-dose immunoglobulin and/or etoposide, engraftment failed in 14 of 18 patients. Of these 14 patients, four received second rescue transplantation and all resulted in successful engraftment. Overall survival rates significantly differed between patients with and without HPS (15.0% vs. 35.4%; P < 0.01). Univariate and multivariate analysis identified having fewer infused CD34(+) cells as a significant risk factor for the development of HPS (P = 0.01 and 0.006, respectively). We concluded that engraftment failure closely correlated with HPS in our cohort, which negatively impacted overall survival after CBT."

In the present study, we investigated the potential anti-human ovarian cancer effects of NSC606985, a novel and rarely studied camptothecin analog, and its combination with cisplatin (CDDP). Human ovarian cancer cell line COC1 cells were treated with different nanomolar of NSC606985 with or without CDDP, and cell growth and apoptosis were evaluated, respectively, by MTT assay and annexin-V assay on flow cytometry. Chou-Talalay analysis was used to evaluate combined effect of NSC606985 and CDDP. Western blot was used to detect protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta), caspase-3 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) proteins. Our results showed that NSC606985 at nanomolar concentration induced apoptosis with the activation of PKCdelta in COC1 cells. Especially, NSC606985 presented the significant combined effects on COC1 cells in terms of growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. In addition, NSC606985 significantly antagonized the accumulation of HIF-1alpha stabilized by hypoxia or hypoxia-mimetic agent. These results suggest that NSC606985 and its combination with CDDP present the therapeutic potential on ovarian cancer, and deserve further preclinical and clinical studies."

To clarify the pathogenesis underlying these alterations, in six obese patients (3 males and 3 females, age 20-44 yrs, BMI = 42.1 +/- 2.2) on unrestricted diet we studied the effect of 8 day GHRH pretreatment (1 micrograms/kg iv each day) on the acute somatotropic response to the neurohormone administered both alone and combined with arginine (ARG, 0.5 g/kg iv infused from 0 to 30 min) which likely inhibits the release of hypothalamic somatostatin. Before treatment the GH response to GHRH (AUC: 231.9 +/- 106.4 micrograms/l/h) was potentiated (p < 0.001) by ARG (932.6 +/- 166.2 micrograms/l/h). However, the GH responses to the neurohormone both alone and combined with ARG were lower (p < 0.02 and 0.002, respectively) than in normals (712.4 +/- 111.6 and 2608.3 +/- 453.2 micrograms/l/h, respectively). After repetitive GHRH administration, in obese subjects baseline GH and IGF-I levels were unchanged. Also the GH responses to GHRH both alone (217.3 +/- 68.1 micrograms/l/h) and combined with ARG (756.3 +/- 202.9 micrograms/l/h) were not modified. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the failure of GHRH pretreatment to improve the somatotrope hyporesponsiveness to GHRH both alone and combined with ARG suggesting the existence of a somatotropic defect in obesity."
False,proteomic analysis showed therapy downregulation enzymes involved amino acid metabolism glycolysisgluconeogenesis alcohol catabolism takes place latter probably due cessation alcohol abuse nan,23529134,amino acid,alcohol abuse,"Lipid pathway impairment, decrease in the antioxidant pool and downregulation in amino-acid metabolism are just some of the metabolic variations attributed to chronic HCV infection. All of them have been studied separately, mainly in animal models. Thanks to proteomic analysis we managed to describe (for the fist time to the best of our knowledge), in vivo and in humans, the metabolic alterations caused by HCV, and the recovery of the same alterations during HCV treatment. We performed proteomic analysis on liver specimens of a 28-year-old woman affected by hepatitis C genotype 1a, alcoholism and diabetes mellitus type 1, before and after antiviral treatment with pegylated interferon alpha 2b and ribavirin. The subject, thanks to a patient-tailored therapy, reached Sustained Virological Response. Throughout the treatment period the patient was monitored with subsequent biochemical, clinical and psychological examinations. The data obtained by the patient's close monitoring suggest a direct interaction between insulin resistance and an active HCV genotype 1 infection, with a leading role played by the infection, and not by insulin resistance, as demonstrated by the sharp fall of the insulin units needed per day during treatment. The proteomic analysis showed that after therapy, a downregulation of enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and alcohol catabolism takes place, the latter probably due to cessation of alcohol abuse. On the contrary, the metabolic pathways linked to metabolism of the reactive oxygen species were upregulated after therapy. Finally, a significant alteration in the pathway regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA), a major regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver, was reported. These ""real time"" data confirm in vivo, in humans, that during HCV infection, the pathways related to fatty acids, glucose metabolism and free radical scavenging are inhibited. The same enzyme deficit is completely recovered after HCV eradication."

True,epothilones new class mti may associated grade peripheral neuropathy however neuropathy associated ixabepilone novel epothilone analog generally mild moderate reversible baseline grade levelsnan,18567992,Epothilones,peripheral neuropathy,"Microtubule inhibitor (MTI)-based chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer--including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones--are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone."
True,steroids hydroxy group alphaposition alpha betaconfigurations highly effective protecting pilocarpine mgkg scinduced limbic motor seizures status epilepticus ed values mgkg ipnan,9121607,pilocarpine,seizures,"Several structurally related metabolites of progesterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-20-ones) and deoxycorticosterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-21-diol-20-ones) and their 3 beta-epimers were evaluated for protective activity against pilocarpine-, kainic acid- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizures in mice. Steroids with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine (416 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced limbic motor seizures and status epilepticus (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg/kg, i.p.). The corresponding epimers with the 3-hydroxy group in the beta-position were also effective but less potent (ED50 values, 33.8-63.5, i.p.). Although the neuroactive steroids were considerably less potent than the benzodiazepine clonazepam in protecting against pilocarpine seizures, steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha-configuration had comparable or higher protective index values (TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for seizure protection) than clonazepam, indicating that some neuroactive steroids may have lower relative toxicity. Steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha- or 5 beta,3 alpha-configurations also produced a dose-dependent delay in the onset of limbic seizures induced by kainic acid (32 mg/kg, s.c.), but did not completely protect against the seizures. However, when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the kainic acid-induced limbic seizures and status epilepticus was obtained. The steroids also caused a dose-dependent delay in NMDA (257 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced lethality, but did not completely protect against NMDA seizures or lethality. We conclude that neuroactive steroids are highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine- and kainic acid-induced seizures and status epilepticus in mice, and may be of utility in the treatment of some forms of status epilepticus in humans."
False,caffeine affect velocity middle cerebral artery hyperventilation hypoventilation thinking transcranial doppler studynan,10666980,Caffeine,hypoventilation,"This study examined possible caffeine-mediated changes in blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (VMCA) induced by tests of cerebrovascular responsiveness. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography provided simultaneous bilateral VMCA measures while healthy college students hypoventilated, hyperventilated, and performed cognitive activities (short-term remembering, generating an autobiographical image, solving problems), each in 31-second tests. VMCA measures were obtained from the same persons, in separate testing sessions, when they were noncaffeinated and under two levels of caffeine: a smaller amount (from a cola, 45 mg/12 oz) and a larger amount (from coffee, 117 mg/8 oz). Compared with the no-caffeine control condition, a smaller amount of caffeine had no significant effects on global VMCA, but a larger amount suppressed VMCA by 5.8%. Time-course analyses showed that VMCA (1) followed a triphasic pattern to increase over baselines during hypoventilation regardless of caffeine condition, (2) slowed below baselines during hyperventilation (with the degree of slowing attenuated under caffeine), and (3) increased over baselines during all cognitive activities (ranges 3.8-6.9%). It is concluded that a large amount of caffeine can suppress VMCA, and this possibility should be anticipated when TCD is used to assess cerebral hemovelocity."
False,hypothesized measuring ntprobnp could improve diagnostic evaluation pa enrolled hypertensive patients underwent aldosterone renin ratio arr screening underwent intravenous saline loading test ivslt high arrnan,23943252,aldosterone,hypertensive,"Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most frequent form of secondary hypertension, but diagnostic tools for this disease still lack optimal accuracy. The heart is one important target tissue for damage due to excess aldosterone, and the role of natriuretic peptides is well recognized in diagnosing heart failure. We hypothesized that measuring the NT-proBNP could improve the diagnostic evaluation of PA. We enrolled 132 hypertensive patients, who underwent aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) screening, and 81 underwent an intravenous saline loading test (ivSLT) because of a high ARR. The NT-proBNP level positively correlated with the ARR and inversely correlated with the renin level. The NT-proBNP level was higher in patients with a high ARR than in those with a low ARR and higher in patients with a positive ivSLT than in those with a negative ivSLT. After logistic regression analysis, an NT-proBNP value above the median and male gender were predictors of a positive ivSLT. The proportion of patients with a positive ivSLT ranged from only 23 % in females with a low NT-proBNP to 93 % in males with a high NT-proBNP. NT-proBNP and gender are predictors of a positive PA confirmatory test. These findings highlight the possibility of using NT-proBNP to identify which patients with a high ARR should receive a complete PA diagnostic evaluation."

False,lithium divalproex sodium carbamazepine lamotrigine atypical antipsychotics antidepressants found beneficial treatment elderly patients bipolar disorder nan,17296540,lamotrigine,bipolar disorder,"Bipolar affective disorder is not uncommon in the elderly; prevalence rates in the United States range from 0.1% to 0.4%. However, it accounts for 10% to 25% of all geriatric patients with mood disorders and 5% of patients admitted to geropsychiatric inpatient units. These patients often present a tremendous treatment challenge to clinicians. They frequently have differing treatment needs compared with their younger counterparts because of substantial medical comorbidity and age-related variations in response to therapy. Unfortunately, the management of geriatric bipolar disorder has been relatively neglected compared with the younger population. There continues to be a scarcity of published, controlled trials in the elderly, and no treatment algorithms specific to bipolar disorder in the elderly have been devised."
True,use mdma quantities may considered moderate associated impaired memory functioning heavy use mdma use may lead long lasting memory impairments nan,16574713,MDMA,impaired memory functioning/memory impairments,"Although 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) has been shown to damage brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in animals and possibly humans, little is known about the long-term consequences of MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxic lesions on functions in which 5-HT is involved, such as cognitive function. Because 5-HT transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic 5-HT transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the 5-HT transporter promoter gene region (5-HTTLPR) when studying the effects of MDMA as well as cognitive functioning. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA use on cognitive function, as well as the effects of long-term abstention from MDMA, in subjects genotyped for 5-HTTLPR. A second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and males. Fifteen moderate MDMA users (<55 lifetime tablets), 22 heavy MDMA+ users (>55 lifetime tablets), 16 ex-MDMA+ users (last tablet > 1 year ago) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests. DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5-HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods.A significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks (p = 0.04) but not on reaction times (p = 0.61) or attention/executive functioning (p = 0.59). Heavy and ex-MDMA+ users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than controls. In contrast, no evidence of memory impairment was observed in moderate MDMA users. No significant effect of 5-HTTLPR or gender was observed. While the use of MDMA in quantities that may be considered ""moderate"" is not associated with impaired memory functioning, heavy use of MDMA use may lead to long lasting memory impairments. No effect of 5-HTTLPR or gender on memory function or MDMA use was observed."

This 40-day randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging multicenter study was designed to assess the effect of sertindole on previously neuroleptic-responsive, hospitalized schizophrenic patients (n = 205). Sertindole doses began at 4 mg/day and were increased to 8, 12, or 20 mg/day, depending on randomization. Efficacy measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed by movement rating scales, EPS-related adverse events, and use of anti-EPS medications. A dose-related improvement was observed for PANSS, BPRS, and CGI, with statistically significant mean differences (P < 0.05) between placebo and 20-mg/day sertindole (decreases from baseline of -5.8 versus -16.9 for PANSS, -4.8 versus -10.4 for BPRS, respectively). The differences in CGI final improvement score between placebo and 20-mg/day sertindole were 3.8 versus 2.9, respectively. EPS-related events were comparable in the placebo and sertindole groups. In conclusion, sertindole 20 mg/day was effective, well tolerated, and not associated with significant motor system abnormalities."

We herein present a case of PRES that occurred after 33 days of high-dose bortezomib treatment and propose both overwhelmed cerebral autoregulation and toxin-mediated blood-brain barrier damage as the underlying mechanisms based on the imaging findings. A favorable recovery was observed two days after achieving stringent hypertension control and withholding bortezomib. Follow-up images obtained two weeks later unveiled a dramatic remission, with faint areas of subcortical hyperintensity in the bilateral parieto-occipital regions. With explicit clinical and imaging features, this case highlights the need for early recognition of PRES during the clinical course of bortezomib therapy. "
True,mitomycin associated hemolytic uremic syndrome nan,3108839,Mitomycin C,hemolytic uremic syndrome,"Mitomycin C associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised. It consists of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with mitomycin C treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent. The renal failure usually develops about 8-10 mth after start of mitomycin C treatment and the mortality is approximately 60% from renal failure or pulmonary edema. Renal lesions are similar to those seen in idiopathic HUS and include arteriolar fibrin thrombi, expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls, ischemic wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis. The mechanism of action is postulated as mitomycin C-induced endothelial cell damage. We describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr-old man with gastric adenocarcinoma who developed renal failure and thrombocytopenia while on treatment with mitomycin C and died in pulmonary edema."

Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the trial. Allocation of patients into coumadin or aspirin groups depended upon the patients' choice. Nineteen patients were given coumadin at the adjusted dosage to maintain the therapeutic range of International Normalised Ratio between 1.5-3. Sixty patients were given aspirin at the fixed dosage of 75 mg per day. Six patients were lost to follow-up over the 3 yr period; four in the aspirin group and 2 in the coumadin group. There were three patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke in the aspirin group but none in the coumadin group after three years of follow-up. Six patients had mitral valve replacement during the study (i.e. three patients in each group). There were complications in 12 patients, 10 in the aspirin (16.6 per cent) and 2 in the coumadin (10.5 per cent) group. The complications in coumadin group were minor bleeding over the thigh in one patient and generalised ecchymosis over the whole body in one other. In the aspirin group, the complication was gastrointestional symptoms, mainly epigastric pain, but no frank bleeding was observed. Primary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in chronic rheumatic heart disease was found to be more effective with coumadin than aspirin. Our study does not support the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiac embolism in chronic rheumatic heart disease."

An assay combining cell culture and real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is reported here to verify drug efficacy against C. parvum in vitro. The monolayers of Human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-8) were infected by sporozoites excysted directly on the cells and were incubated with monensin, halofuginone bromide and hexadecylphosphocholine until 45h post infection (p.i.). The genomic DNA was extracted at 3, 27 and 45h p.i. and subjected to qPCR targeting the 70kDa heat shock protein gene to quantify the development of C. parvum. The reliability of the method was validated by testing of monensin and halofuginone bromide, which are well known to be effective in vitro. With the dose dependency monensin and halofuginone showed a maximum inhibition of 98.15% and 98.05% at 0.144 and 25microM, respectively, compared with non-treated controls at the endpoint incubation, confirming previous reports. The reduction of the parasite DNA reproduction over 27h p.i. compared with 3h p.i. was found to be as 97-99% in 0.144microM monensin and 99% in 25microM halofuginone treated cells. The new antileishmanial compound hexadecylphosphocholine (24.5microM, Miltefosine) showed 78-98% inhibition at 45h p.i., however, the reproduction of parasite DNA was reduced to 96-98% over 27h p.i.

Strategies of extended-interval and conventional dosing have been utilized extensively in the general medical population; however, data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology/oncology population. To evaluate amikacin-associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology/oncology population, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted at a university-affiliated medical center. Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic/oncologic disorder that required treatment with an aminoglycoside were randomized to either conventional or extended-interval amikacin. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity by means of an increase in serum creatinine and evaluation of efficacy via amikacin serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended-interval groups, at 10% and 5%, respectively (P = 1.00). Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture, compared with none in the extended-interval group (P = 0.002). The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the two dosing regimens, but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups. Efficacy could not be assessed."

We evaluated the effects of daltroban on (i) human platelet shape change and aggregation in vitro, and (ii) mean systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures (MAP and MPAP, respectively) as well as haematocrit, in anaesthetized, open-chest Sprague-Dawley rats, compared with those of a chemically distinct prostanoid thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptor antagonist, SQ 29,548, and agonist, U-46619. 2. In human platelets in vitro, daltroban (10 nM-100 microM; n = 6 per group) concentration-dependently induced shape change, attaining at 50 microM, a maximum amplitude of 0.83 +/- 0.09 mV representing 46.4 +/- 4.8% of that evoked by U-46619 (1.78 +/- 0.20 mV at 0.2 microM; n = 9); and inhibited U-46619-induced platelet aggregation with an IC50 of 77 (41-161)nM. SQ 29,548 (10 nM-100 microM; n = 6 per group) failed to evoke any platelet shape change, but potently inhibited U-46619-induced platelet aggregation with an IC50 < 10 nM. 3. In anaesthetized rats in vivo, daltroban (10-2500 micrograms kg-1, i.v. infused over 2 min; n = 4-8 per group) produced a bell-shaped dose-response curve for MPAP and haematocrit, and evoked maximal increases of 12.7 +/- 2.1 mmHg and 5.8 +/- 1.5% at 80 micrograms kg-1 (n = 6) and 630 micrograms kg-1 (n = 8), respectively (both P < 0.05) with ED50s of 20 (16-29) and 217 (129-331) micrograms kg-1, respectively. By comparison, U-46619(0.16-20 microg kg-1, i.v.), induced dose-dependent increases in MPAP and haematocrit (25.4 +/- 1.0 mmHg and 16.1 +/- 2.9% at the highest dose; n = 12, both P<0.01), with ED50s of 1.8 (1.3-2.5) and 3.9(3.5- 5.4) microg kg- 1, respectively. Daltroban dose-dependently increased MAP with a maximum amplitude of 42.2 +/- 4.4 mmHg at a dose of 80 microg kg-1 [ED50 = 94 (64-125) microg kg-1], similar to that induced by U-46619 (41.3 +/- 9.6 mmHg) at a dose of 0.63 microg kg-1 [ED50= 0.22 (0.13-0.24) microg kg-1]. SQ 29,548(10-2500 microg kg-1, i.v.; n =4 per group) failed to modify significantly any of these parameters.4. Our results clearly demonstrate that daltroban, in a similar manner to the TxA2 analogue, U-46619,but unlike the TxA2 receptor antagonist, SQ 29,548, exhibits significant intrinsic activity in human platelets in vitro and in the rat vasculature in vivo, possibly through TxA2 receptor activation."

False,study clinical profile multiple myeloma effect thalidomide based treatment outcome indian scenario aims objective studynan,23469567,thalidomide,multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy that leads to bone pain, pathological fracture, anaemia, renal failure and recurrent bacterial infections. Recently, thalidomide has demonstrated significant activity in the treatment of multiple myeloma in various western studies. In India there are very minimal studies about multiple myeloma. To study the clinical profile of multiple myeloma and the effect of thalidomide based treatment on its outcome in the Indian scenario are the aims and objective of the study. A total of 25 multiple myeloma cases were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma was made based on the presence of greater than 10% plasma cells on bone marrow, an M band in serum electrophoresis and/or a skeletal survey revealing osteolytic lesions. All the above patients were treated with tablet thalidomide 200 mg once daily on all days and tablet dexamethasone 40 mg once daily on days 1-4, 9-12, 17-20 in a 28 days cycle for 4 cycles. At the end of four cycles, all patients were re-evaluated and the response rate was assessed. The most common clinical presentation (56%) was bone related like bony swelling, bone pain, low backache and pathological fractures. The overall response rate to thal-dexa regimen was 72% (n=18). Out of these, 10 patients (56%) had complete response and 8 patients (44%) had partial response. The mean bone marrow plasma cell percentage at the end of therapy was 2% compared to 56% before therapy which was significant (p < 0.0001). None of the patients developed neutropenia or thrombocytopenia during treatment. Although multiple myeloma has remained an incurable disease to date, presently available thalidomide based combination chemotherapy represents an active inductive regimen to improve the outcome and achieve eventual cure."

In this study we determined if a low-protein diet or oral sorbent (AST-120) could reduce the serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate in 5/6-nephrectomized uremic rats and undialyzed uremic patients. The uremic rats were treated by fasting or AST-120 for 2 days. The serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate dramatically decreased 1-2 days after fasting or AST-120 treatment. We then measured the serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate and calculated protein intake from urinary amounts of urea nitrogen using Maroni's equation in 80 undialyzed uremic patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min. The serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate were significantly lower in the patients on a low-protein diet than in those in the normal-protein diet group. Administration of AST-120 significantly decreased serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate in 22 undialyzed uremic patients. In conclusion, a low-protein diet or AST-120 reduced the serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate, a stimulating factor for glomerular sclerosis, in both uremic rats and undialyzed uremic patients."

After intravenous administration of labetalol, metoprolol and midazolam the patient's condition improved, and 15 min later he woke up. The block was successful and surgery was conducted as scheduled despite persisting atrial fibrillation. Postoperatively, the patient refused DC cardioversion and was treated medically. Both the temporal relationship of events and the response to treatment suggest that a rapid systemic absorption of mepivacaine with adrenaline and/or interaction of these drugs with the patient's cardiovascular medications were responsible for the perioperative complications."
False,chronic cbz also decreased incidence seizure related mortality cocaineinjected ratsnan,2790457,CBZ,seizure,"The effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) treatment on local anesthetic-kindled seizures and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of CBZ administration. Chronic oral CBZ inhibited the development of both lidocaine- and cocaine-induced seizures, but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic seizures. Chronic CBZ also decreased the incidence of seizure-related mortality in the cocaine-injected rats. Acute CBZ over a range of doses (15-50 mg/kg) had no effect on completed lidocaine-kindled or acute cocaine-induced seizures. Repeated i.p. injection of CBZ (15 mg/kg) also was without effect on the development of lidocaine- or cocaine-kindled seizures. The differential effects of CBZ depending upon stage of seizure development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic-kindled seizures. The effectiveness of chronic but not repeated, intermittent injections of CBZ suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment regimens. The possible utility of chronic CBZ in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human cocaine users is suggested by these data, but remains to be directly evaluated."
True,investigate factors influencing effects addressed three questions intensity dizziness nausea nin unsteadiness dependent nicotine dosagenan,17990061,nicotine,unsteadiness,"Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."

True,cognitive physical impairments confusion abnormal coordination occur transdermal fentanyl nan,14583070,fentanyl,physical impairments,"Transdermal fentanyl is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of chronic pain caused by malignancy and non-malignant conditions when administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Compared with oral opioids, the advantages of transdermal fentanyl include a lower incidence and impact of adverse effects (constipation, nausea and vomiting, and daytime drowsiness), a higher degree of patient satisfaction, improved quality of life, improved convenience and compliance resulting from administration every 72 hours, and decreased use of rescue medication. Transdermal fentanyl is a useful analgesic for cancer patients who are unable to swallow or have gastrointestinal problems. Transdermal fentanyl forms a depot within the upper skin layers before entering the microcirculation. Therapeutic blood levels are attained 12-16 hours after patch application and decrease slowly with a half-life of 16-22 hours following removal. Patients with chronic pain should be titrated to adequate relief with short-acting oral or parenteral opioids prior to the initiation of transdermal fentanyl in order to prevent exacerbations of pain or opioid-related adverse effects. Transdermal fentanyl can then be initiated based on the 24-hour opioid requirement once adequate analgesia has been achieved. The prolonged elimination of transdermal fentanyl can become problematic if patients develop opioid-related adverse effects, especially hypoventilation. Adverse effects do not improve immediately after patch removal and may take many hours to resolve. Patients who experience opioid-related toxicity associated with respiratory depression should be treated immediately with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone and closely monitored for at least 24 hours. Because of the short half-life of naloxone, sequential doses or a continuous infusion of the opioid antagonist may be necessary. Transdermal fentanyl should be administered cautiously to patients with pre-existing conditions such as emphysema that may predispose them to the development of hypoventilation. Transdermal fentanyl is indicated only for patients who require continuous opioid administration for the treatment of chronic pain that cannot be managed with other medications. It is contraindicated in the management of acute and postoperative pain, as pain may decrease more rapidly in these circumstances than fentanyl blood levels can be adjusted, leading to the development of life-threatening hypoventilation. Cognitive and physical impairments such as confusion and abnormal co-ordination can occur with transdermal fentanyl. Therefore, patients should be instructed to refrain from driving or operating machinery immediately following the initiation of transdermal fentanyl, or after any dosage increase. Patients may resume such activities once the absence of these potential adverse effects is documented."
False,opioid rotation morphine fentanyl delirious cancer patients openlabel trialnan,16043013,fentanyl,delirious cancer,"Although recent studies suggest that opioid rotation could be an effective treatment strategy for morphine-induced delirium, there have been no prospective studies to investigate the treatment effects of opioid rotation using fentanyl. The primary aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in symptom palliation of morphine-induced delirium. Twenty-one consecutive cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium underwent opioid rotation to fentanyl. Physicians recorded the symptom severity of delirium (the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, MDAS), pain, and other symptoms (categorical verbal scale from 0: none to 3: severe) and the Schedule for Team Assessment Scale (STAS) (from 0: none to 4: extreme); and performance status at the time of study enrollment and three and seven days after. Of 21 patients recruited, one patient did not complete the study. In the remaining 20 patients, morphine was substituted with transdermal fentanyl in 9 patients and parenteral fentanyl in 11 patients. Total opioid dose increased from 64 mg oral morphine equivalent/day (Day 0) to 98 mg/day (Day 7), and the median increase in total opioid dose was 42%. Treatment success, defined as an MDAS score below 10 and pain score of 2 or less, was obtained in 13 patients on Day 3 and 18 patients on Day 7. The mean MDAS score significantly decreased from 14 (Day 0) to 6.4 and 3.6 (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Pain scores significantly decreased from 2.2 (Day 0) to 1.3 and 1.1 on the categorical verbal scale (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001); from 2.6 (Day 0) to 1.6 and 1.3 on the STAS (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Symptom scores of dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting significantly decreased, and performance status significantly improved. Opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl may be effective in alleviating delirium and pain in cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium."

In vivo these substances significantly reduced the weight of neuroblastoma tumour transplants in the mice (nude/nude) (P less than 0.05). A dose/effect relationship could be established. In vitro, the D50 was determined, using fibroblasts as controls. The growth of neuroblastoma tumours was inhibited by different mechanisms: L-dopa and its metabolite dopamine reduced the activity of tyrosinase, BSO reduced glutathione levels, and L-dopa and tamoxifen raised cAMP concentrations."
True,quetiapine appears increased risk sedation bodyweight gain albeit less olanzapinenan,11772153,Quetiapine,bodyweight gain,"Antipsychotics are frequently used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Atypical antipsychotics have come to the forefront in child psychiatry due largely to their tolerability profiles as well as their efficacy. Potential treatment options include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. A number of studies investigating the use of clozapine have been published in children; however, owing to the frequent monitoring required for agranulocytosis, the use of clozapine may be restricted to patients with treatment-refractory disease. With accumulating data on the development of glucose intolerance in adults receiving clozapine, closer monitoring of bodyweight and fasting blood glucose is imperative. Clozapine also has an increased seizure risk, therefore a baseline electroencephalogram should be performed, as well as continued vigilance for this adverse effect. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that is generally well tolerated and numerous studies have been published investigating this drug in children. Unlike clozapine, its receptor interaction profile lends itself toward increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinaemia. Bodyweight gain is a common adverse effect, although somewhat less than that reported with olanzapine. Baseline liver function studies prior to initiation of this medication are recommended. Risperidone-induced mania has been reported in adults and, therefore, increased caution should be used when deciding to treat children and adolescents with risperidone, particularly in those with a predisposition toward mania. Olanzapine, like risperidone, has also been associated with onset of mania in adults. Olanzapine has a receptor profile that results in significant risk for bodyweight gain and sedation. Furthermore, this drug has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance; thus, it is important to monitor bodyweight and fasting blood glucose on a frequent basis. Less information is known about quetiapine in children and adolescents. Reports about its efficacy and tolerability vary. Quetiapine appears to have increased risk for sedation and bodyweight gain, albeit less than that of olanzapine. The compound appears to be less likely to induce EPS. Finally, ziprasidone has recently been approved for use in the adult population. This compound, in terms of its receptor profile, has more in common with risperidone. This suggests a potential for increased risk of EPS and hyperprolactinaemia. It also has an increased risk of QTc prolongation; thus, a baseline electrocardiogram is suggested, particularly in those patients with a history of cardiovascular illness. Lack of evidence for bodyweight gain with ziprasidone is a considerable advantage."

Chronic pulmonary sequelae in response to silicone injection have not been previously described. We report a case of chronic progressive granulomatous pneumonitis in response to subcutaneous silicone injections in a transgender male-to-female patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). After receiving silicone injections to the buttock, the patient developed rapid onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and chills. Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse peripheral interstitial opacities. She responded symptomatically to prednisone with subsequent intermittent symptomatic flares. Four years later, she developed marked dyspnea and cough. Chest computed tomography showed progressive diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities. Lung biopsies demonstrated numerous spheroid silicone particles within the lung interstitium and small pulmonary vessels, surrounded by foreign body giant cells and nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation. We speculate that HIV-1-infected patients may be at risk for chronic, progressive granulomatous pneumonitis due to silicone injection years after their procedure owing to shifting levels of cell-mediated immunity."
True,polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs persistent environmental toxicants present ofus adults dosedependently associated obesity nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafldnan,24812009,Polychlorinated biphenyls/PCBs,obesity,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent environmental toxicants, present in 100% of U.S. adults and dose-dependently associated with obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). PCBs are predicted to interact with receptors previously implicated in xenobiotic/energy metabolism and NAFLD. These receptors include the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), liver-X-receptor (LXRα), and farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR). This study evaluates Aroclor 1260, a PCB mixture with congener composition mimicking that of human adipose tissue, and selected congeners, as potential ligands for these receptors utilizing human hepatoma-derived (HepG2) and primate-derived (COS-1) cell lines, and primary human hepatocytes. Aroclor 1260 (20 μg/ml) activated AhR, and PCB 126, a minor component, was a potent inducer. Aroclor 1260 activated PXR in a simple concentration-dependent manner at concentrations ≥10 μg/ml. Among the congeners tested, PCBs 138, 149, 151, 174, 183, 187, and 196 activated PXR. Aroclor 1260 activated CAR2 and CAR3 variants at lower concentrations and antagonize CAR2 activation by the CAR agonist, CITCO, at higher concentrations (≥20 μg/ml). Additionally, Aroclor 1260 induced CYP2B6 in primary hepatocytes. At subtoxic doses, Aroclor 1260 did not activate LXR or FXR and had no effect on LXR- or FXR-dependent induction by the agonists T0901317 or GW4064, respectively. Aroclor 1260 (20 μg/ml) suppressed PPARα activation by the agonist nafenopin, although none of the congeners tested demonstrated significant inhibition. The results suggest that Aroclor 1260 is a human AhR, PXR and CAR3 agonist, a mixed agonist/antagonist for CAR2, and an antagonist for human PPARα. "

True,confirms presence significant negative interactions oestrogen use obesity possibly oc wellnan,8398274,oestrogen,obesity,"The relationship between oestrogen replacement treatment and the risk of endometrial cancer was analysed in a case-control study of 158 histologically confirmed incident cases below the age of 75 and 468 controls in hospital for acute, non-neoplastic, non-hormone-related conditions conducted in the Swiss Canton of Vaud in 1988-1992. Overall, 60 (38%) cases vs. 93 (20%) controls had ever used oestrogen replacement treatment: the corresponding multiple logistic regression relative risk (RR) was 2.7 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.7-4.1). The risk was directly related to duration of use, and rose to 5.1 (95% CI: 2.7-9.8) for > 5 year-use. The RR was still significantly elevated 10 or more years after stopping use (RR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2-4.5). When the role of covariates was considered, a significant interaction was observed with body mass index (RR for long-term oestrogen use = 6.0 for lean or normal weight women vs. 2.4 for overweight women). There was also a hint of a negative interaction with oral contraceptive (OC) use, since the RR for oestrogens was higher (or restricted) to women who had never used OC (RR = 5.4, for long-term oestrogen use), as compared with those who had used OC, who showed no significant evidence of association with oestrogens (RR = 0.9 for long-term use). There was no significant interaction with cigarette smoking. Thus, this study confirms the presence of a strong association between oestrogen replacement treatment and endometrial cancer risk, since in the late 1980s or early 1990s about 25% of cases could be attributed to oestrogen replacement treatment in this Swiss population. Further, it confirms the presence of significant negative interactions of oestrogen use with obesity, and, possibly, with OC as well."

True,report venlafaxine maoi interaction resulted serotonin syndrome yold male taking tranylcypromine depressionnan,8888541,venlafaxine,serotonin syndrome,"Excessive stimulation of serotonin 5HT1A receptors causes a syndrome of serotonin excess that consists of shivering, muscle rigidity, salivation, confusion, agitation and hyperthermia. The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. We report a venlafaxine-MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23-y-old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression. He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1/2 tab of venlafaxine. Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities, tremors and rigidity. He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering, myoclonic jerks, rigidity, salivation and diaphoresis. His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light. Vital signs were: blood pressure 120/67 mm Hg, heart rate 127/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and temperature 97 F. After 180 mg of diazepam i.v. he remained tremulous with muscle rigidity and clenched jaws. He was intubated for airway protection and because of hypoventilation, and was paralyzed to control muscle rigidity. His subsequent course was remarkable for non-immune thrombocytopenia which resolved. The patient's maximal temperature was 101.2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units/L with no other evidence of rhabdomyolysis. His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward.

False,vitro pentoxifylline ptx inhibits monocyte production tf response endotoxin well endothelial cell production tf response tumor necrosis factoralpha tnfalphanan,8699848,pentoxifylline/PTX,necrosis,"Tissue factor (TF) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that acts as the cell receptor for factor VII and activated factor VII (VIIa) and as the co-factor for VIIa. Because binding of factor VII/VIIa to its receptor is the first step in the activation of the coagulation process, TF is not normally expressed by circulating cells. Monocytes and endothelial cells are, however, capable of producing TF in response to diverse stimuli. TF expression is believed to be responsible for thrombotic complications associated with certain diseases. In vitro, pentoxifylline (PTX) inhibits monocyte production of TF in response to endotoxin, as well as endothelial cell production of TF in response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). In vivo, injection of PTX into primates prevents the activation of coagulation by endotoxin. The potential benefit of this treatment in patients with septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation, as well as in other clinical conditions in which TF expression is increased, remains to be determined in well-designed clinical trials."

Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the trial. Allocation of patients into coumadin or aspirin groups depended upon the patients' choice. Nineteen patients were given coumadin at the adjusted dosage to maintain the therapeutic range of International Normalised Ratio between 1.5-3. Sixty patients were given aspirin at the fixed dosage of 75 mg per day. Six patients were lost to follow-up over the 3 yr period; four in the aspirin group and 2 in the coumadin group. There were three patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke in the aspirin group but none in the coumadin group after three years of follow-up. Six patients had mitral valve replacement during the study (i.e. three patients in each group). There were complications in 12 patients, 10 in the aspirin (16.6 per cent) and 2 in the coumadin (10.5 per cent) group. The complications in coumadin group were minor bleeding over the thigh in one patient and generalised ecchymosis over the whole body in one other. In the aspirin group, the complication was gastrointestional symptoms, mainly epigastric pain, but no frank bleeding was observed. Primary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in chronic rheumatic heart disease was found to be more effective with coumadin than aspirin.

Antiproliferative activity was highly dependent on drug exposure time. Except for CP 46,665, which reached maximal activity after 2 hr, 40 microM ether lipids were effective only after 24 hr. Structural modifications of ether lipids can increase their potency and reduce the time required for antiproliferative activity. Ether lipid analogs may be useful for treating human gliomas."

Lignocaine (1 mg/kg) was also given intravenously to 15 patients, and the metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) was measured as an indicator of liver function. Epirubicin clearance correlated with serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin and bilirubin values in patients treated intravenously or intraarterially. Although the route of administration did not affect the median total plasma clearance of epirubicin, early- and intermediate-phase clearance was higher following intraarterial administration. MEGX levels correlated with serum bilirubin levels but there was no correlation with albumin or AST values or epirubicin clearance. The rate of response to epirubicin was 3/13 (23%; 95% confidence interval, 8%-50%). Intravenous epirubicin was tolerated well, but intraarterial treatment was associated with significant morbidity. These data confirm that although current recommended dose adjustments are based primarily on serum bilirubin levels, altered epirubicin pharmacokinetics correlate more strongly with AST and albumin values than with serum bilirubin concentrations. However, at this dose and schedule, epirubicin has only modest activity against HCC."

Cordycepin significantly inhibited the proliferation of human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)-C and human melanoma SK-MEL-2 cells with IC50 values of 120 microM and 80 microM, respectively. Cordycepin treatment at 120 microM and 80 microM, respectively, induced apoptosis in both cells and caused the increase of cell accumulation in a time-dependent manner at the apoptotic sub-G1 phase, as evidenced by the flow cytometry (FCM) and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) analyses. Western blot analysis revealed the induction of active caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage by cordycepin treatment.

We measured R-R interval (RR), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), blood pressure (BP), and their variability in 10 normal subjects during sympathetic activation achieved by BP lowering with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and alpha-adrenergic blockade using phentolamine. SNP and phentolamine induced comparable reductions in BP (P > 0.25). Despite tachycardia and sympathetic activation with both SNP and phentolamine, LF variability in RR, MSNA, and BP increased during SNP and decreased during phentolamine (SNP: RR +20 +/- 6%, MSNA +3 +/- 5%, systolic BP +9 +/- 6%, diastolic BP +7 +/- 5%; phentolamine: RR -2 +/- 7%, MSNA -34 +/- 6%, systolic BP -16 +/- 8%, diastolic BP -13 +/- 4%, P < 0.05 except systolic BP, where P = 0.09). Thus LF variability is reduced when sympathetic activation is induced by alpha-adrenergic blockade. This suggests that alpha-adrenergic transmission within the baroreflex loop may contribute importantly to the predominance of LF cardiovascular variability associated with sympathetic excitation in humans."
True,rechallenge androgen produced symptoms obstructive sleep apnea abated upon withdrawal hormonenan,6732043,androgen,obstructive sleep apnea,"We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54-yr-old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea while being administered exogenous androgens. When the androgens were withdrawn, the patient's physical changes, symptoms, sleep study, and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal. A rechallenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone. Previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. Our report provides direct evidence for this role.

False,pentoxifylline analogues may lower toxicity pentoxifylline may therefore useful future treatment diseases induced endotoxic substancesnan,9160101,pentoxifylline,toxicity,"Pentoxifylline and the two analogues HWA138 and HWA448, at concentrations exceeding 60 micrograms/ml, inhibited malaria antigen or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha secretion, but not IL-6 secretion, from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. HWA448 had lower inhibitory activity in vitro than pentoxifylline and HWA138. A small enhancement of cytokine secretion was induced by pentoxifylline and the two analogues at low concentrations. The drugs did not affect cell viability. Pentoxifylline, HWA138 and HWA448 also inhibited LPS induced TNF production in vivo in female CF1xBalb/c mice. The drugs were inhibitory at 0.5-1 mg per mouse when mixed with LPS, and 1 mg per mouse of the drugs was inhibitory when injected 1 h before LPS challenge. HWA448 had similar inhibitory activities in vivo compared to pentoxifylline and HWA138, possibly because of the longer serum half-life of HWA448. The pentoxifylline analogues may have lower toxicity than pentoxifylline itself and may therefore be useful in future treatment of diseases induced by endotoxic substances."

False,hifalpha unfavorable determinant relapse gastric cancer patients underwent curative surgery followed adjuvant 5-fu chemotherapynan,20020496,5-FU,gastric cancer,"Among several chemotherapeutic agents, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been widely used as a key drug in adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer. However, no reliable marker, which predicts the response to 5-FU in an adjuvant setting, has been identified. Hypoxia-induced drug resistance, via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, is a major obstacle in the development of effective cancer therapy. However, few clinical studies have so far assessed the relationship between the HIF-1alpha expression and the chemo-resistance of gastric cancer patients in an adjuvant setting. We established 2 HIF-1alpha knockdown gastric cancer cell lines in order to clarify the role of HIF-1alpha in chemo-resistance against 5-FU. Furthermore, expression of HIF-1alpha was immunohistochemically assessed in 91 resected specimens. Sixty-four of 91 patients received 5-FU adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. HIF-1alpha expression was associated with the significantly shorter relapse-free survival and disease-specific survival in the 64 patients of adjuvant group (p = 0.026, 0.014, respectively), but not in the 27 of surgery group. Multivariate analysis showed that HIF-1alpha was an independent risk factor for relapse in 64 patients in the adjuvant group (p = 0.029). In conclusion, the current study confirmed, for the first time that HIF-1alpha expression is an independent risk factor for relapse in high-risk gastric cancer patients who underwent curative surgery followed by adjuvant 5-FU chemotherapy. A favorable effect of 5-FU might therefore be expected in patients that do not express HIF-1alpha, whereas, other types of chemotherapy or additional treatments, such as HIF-1alpha inhibitors, should be considered in patients that do express HIF-1alpha."
False,effect calciumentry blocker nicardipine intrarenal hemodynamics essential hypertension nan,1986570,nicardipine,hypertension,"The effects of a calcium-entry blocker, nicardipine, on intrarenal hemodynamics were studied in essential hypertension. A 4-week study was performed in eight patients with essential hypertension who were given a regular sodium diet in the first and third weeks, and a sodium-restricted diet in the second and fourth weeks. Nicardipine, 60 mg/d, was administered in the third and fourth weeks. The urinary sodium excretion rate (UNaV) was plotted on the y-axis against the mean arterial pressure (MAP) on the x-axis before and after the administration of nicardipine. Assuming the difference between MAP and the x-intercept of this renal function curve represents the effective filtration pressure across the glomerular capillaries, the intrarenal hemodynamics such as afferent arteriolar resistance (RA) and efferent arteriolar resistances (RE), glomerular pressure (PG), and gross filtration coefficient (KFG) were calculated. Although the MAP on regular salt diet was lowered from 125 +/- 3 to 109 +/- 2 mm Hg by nicardipine, neither the renal blood flow rate (RBF) (670 +/- 40 mL/min) nor the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (79 +/- 2 mL/min) was altered. The RA was estimated to be reduced from 9,300 +/- 900 to 7,400 +/- 700 dyne.s.cm-5 (P less than 0.01), while no changes were noted in RE (4,900 +/- 400 dyne.s.cm-5), PG (50 +/- 1 mm Hg), or KFG (0.180 +/- 0.041 [mL/s]/mm Hg). Essential hypertension has been characterized by a prominent increase in RA, resulting in maintenance of normal PG. This Ca-entry blocker worked to normalize intrarenal hemodynamics in essential hypertension by dilating afferent arterioles alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

MRD monitoring by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed at the end of induction and at ~3-month intervals thereafter. Median age was 54 years (range, 21-84 years). There was no difference in survival by achievement of at least a major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL/ABL < 0.1%) at CR (P = .22). Patients achieving MMR at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months had a better survival (P = .02, .04, .05, and .01, respectively). Negative MFC at CR did not predict for improved survival (P = .2). At 3 and 12 months, negative MRD by MFC was associated with improved survival (P = .04 and .001).

The TGF-beta 2 isoform has been shown to be present in high concentrations in breast cyst fluid and might have a protective role in breast cancer. In addition, oestrogens play an important role in breast cancer development, and oestrone sulphate (E1S) might be the main source of active oestrogens in the breast. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of TGF-beta 2 on oestrogen synthesis in an attempt to understand the mechanism by which TGF-beta 2 may exert a protective effect in breast cancer. In this study, higher concentrations of TGF-beta 2 significantly inhibited the conversion of E1S to oestrone (E1) and the conversion of E1 to the potent oestrogen, oestradiol (E2). TGF-beta 2 did not have any effect on MCF-7 cell growth or on E2 to E1 conversion. In conclusion, TGF-beta 2 might exert a protective role in breast cancer by reducing the amount of active oestrogens present in the breast."

However, a role in the process for MHC Class I restricted T-cells remains a matter of debate. In this study, we examined by confocal microscopy the pancreatic expression of MHC Class I protein, insulin, and ICA 512 protein tyrosine phosphatase in C57BL/Ks mice given 40 mg/kg bw streptozotocin IP on 5 consecutive days. All animals were hyperglycemic from Day 7 and onwards. A loss of ICA 512 from the central portions of the islets was noted on Day 3. On Day 7, an increase in MHC Class I expression, confined primarily to immune cells in the exocrine pancreas and the periinsular areas, was detected. Later, several MHC class I/glucagon and some MHC class I/insulin double-positive cells were found. The insulitis was maximal on Day 14 and declined thereafter. The induction of MHC Class I expression in endocrine cells, occuring only after the cellular infiltration and when the animals were diabetic, indicates that the immune component of the disease does not depend on MHC Class I-restricted cytotoxic T-cells but rather comprises a non-antigen-specific process.

Urinary adrenaline (A) concentrations were not elevated in the hyperthermia cases, nor were there any significant differences in urinary dopamine (DA) concentrations between the two groups. All except one of the hyperthermia victims were under the influence of ethanol. It is suggested that a combination of heat stress and ethanol consumption was responsible for the elevated urinary NA in the hyperthermia cases, reflecting increased sympathetic nervous system activity. A combination of high urinary NA with low A seems to be characteristic of hyperthermia fatalities, in contrast to hypothermia deaths, where both NA and A are usually elevated."
True,cognitive physical impairments confusion abnormal coordination occur transdermal fentanyl nan,14583070,fentanyl,confusion,"Transdermal fentanyl is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of chronic pain caused by malignancy and non-malignant conditions when administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Compared with oral opioids, the advantages of transdermal fentanyl include a lower incidence and impact of adverse effects (constipation, nausea and vomiting, and daytime drowsiness), a higher degree of patient satisfaction, improved quality of life, improved convenience and compliance resulting from administration every 72 hours, and decreased use of rescue medication. Transdermal fentanyl is a useful analgesic for cancer patients who are unable to swallow or have gastrointestinal problems. Transdermal fentanyl forms a depot within the upper skin layers before entering the microcirculation. Therapeutic blood levels are attained 12-16 hours after patch application and decrease slowly with a half-life of 16-22 hours following removal. Patients with chronic pain should be titrated to adequate relief with short-acting oral or parenteral opioids prior to the initiation of transdermal fentanyl in order to prevent exacerbations of pain or opioid-related adverse effects. Transdermal fentanyl can then be initiated based on the 24-hour opioid requirement once adequate analgesia has been achieved. The prolonged elimination of transdermal fentanyl can become problematic if patients develop opioid-related adverse effects, especially hypoventilation. Adverse effects do not improve immediately after patch removal and may take many hours to resolve. Patients who experience opioid-related toxicity associated with respiratory depression should be treated immediately with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone and closely monitored for at least 24 hours. Because of the short half-life of naloxone, sequential doses or a continuous infusion of the opioid antagonist may be necessary. Transdermal fentanyl should be administered cautiously to patients with pre-existing conditions such as emphysema that may predispose them to the development of hypoventilation. Transdermal fentanyl is indicated only for patients who require continuous opioid administration for the treatment of chronic pain that cannot be managed with other medications. It is contraindicated in the management of acute and postoperative pain, as pain may decrease more rapidly in these circumstances than fentanyl blood levels can be adjusted, leading to the development of life-threatening hypoventilation. Cognitive and physical impairments such as confusion and abnormal co-ordination can occur with transdermal fentanyl. Therefore, patients should be instructed to refrain from driving or operating machinery immediately following the initiation of transdermal fentanyl, or after any dosage increase. Patients may resume such activities once the absence of these potential adverse effects is documented."

False,hemobiology vascular disease review potential gliclazide influence pathogenesis diabetic vascular diseasenan,7833498,gliclazide,vascular disease,"Patients with type II diabetes commonly die from thrombotic vascular disease. Large vessel occlusion due to thrombosis or atherosclerotic stenosis is a process accelerated by diabetes and results in premature death. Diabetic small vessel disease, with its unique microangiopathic process, underlies many of the large vessel changes as well as causing retinopathy and nephropathy. The microangiopathic changes produce a prothrombotic tendency that has been widely reported in type II diabetes. There is reduced endothelial cell production of prostacyclin and the activators of fibrinolysis, together with increased platelet reactivity. In addition, there is increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress due to excess free-radical activity and impaired antioxidant defenses particularly in the presence of microvascular disease. The development of many of these abnormalities is associated with poor long-term glycemic control. However, the changes are also seen in atherosclerosis in nondiabetic patients where the progression of the disease can be modified by antiplatelet agents and antioxidants. The process of vascular damage is accelerated by diabetes, often due to co-existing disease and aging, although it is not clear that improvement in long-term glycemic control by lowering blood glucose levels to near to the nondiabetic state reduces the development of small and large vessel disease. Although the biochemical mechanism underlying this observation remains uncertain, protein glycosylation and increased platelet reactivity are implicated and interrelated. Increased oxidative stress due to excess free-radical activity may be central to diabetic vascular disease as endothelial cell damage, lipoprotein oxidation, modification of both platelet reactivity and arachidonic acid cascade are all properties of free radicals and their reaction products lipid peroxides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III)."

It has been claimed that there is such a high correlation between a positive history of nickel hypersensitivity and patch-test results that testing is unnecessary if there is a history of hypersensitivity. This is not true. Nickel hypersensitivity itself is not a serious health problem for the individual. However, when hand eczema also is present, the situation is quite different. Concerns about medical metal implants in nickel-sensitive persons appear to have been exaggerated, and nickel intake in food probably is not a serious difficulty, although some persons may be unusually sensitive. In dealing with the clinical problems of nickel dermatitis, we must not overlook prophylaxis. It seems important to introduce safe methods of ear piercing (a primary source of nickel hypersensitivity) and to spread information about the health hazard potential of the seemingly harmless sensitivity to nickel."

It has been reported that c-Cbl and Cbl-b mRNAs are up-regulated during TPA-induced U937 and HL-60 cell differentiation. But the mechanism of the up-regulation and the roles of the Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases still remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that bufalin enhanced all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, accompanied by up-regulation of the Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases. CsA, an inhibitor of calcium mobilization, reversed this up-regulation. Pretreatment with CsA and PS-341 did not affect the expression of CD11b, but suppressed the percentage of adherent cells. Lipid raft localization of Cbl-b enhanced cell adhesion, while C-terminal deletion partially suppressed the effect. Moreover, the expression of the adhesion-related kinases Pyk2 and Paxillin was up-regulated in parallel with the increase of Cbl proteins. These results suggested that up-regulation of c-Cbl and Cbl-b was involved in the regulation of ATRA and bufalin-induced HL-60 cell adhesion rather than cell differentiation, which might be mediated by lipid raft localization, ubiquitin ligase activity and C-terminal structure of Cbl proteins. Meanwhile, up-regulation of proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) and Paxillin might also be implicated in this regulation."

A meta-analysis of early trials of adjuvant chemotherapy by the Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Collaborative Group showed that while chemotherapy with alkylating agents was also detrimental, chemotherapy with cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with an improved hazard ratio for death (HR = 0.87), equating to a 5 percent survival benefit at 5 years. However, the result was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Recently, results have been reported for several large Phase III trials of adjuvant chemotherapy which differed with respect to the stage of resected disease included, the type of chemotherapy used and the use of post-operative radiotherapy. Three trials (IALT, JBR 10, and ANITA) that utilized cisplatin-based doublets showed a significantly positive survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with Stage II-IIIA NSCLC. The magnitude of this benefit, which was suggested to be 4-5 percent at 5 years in the meta-analysis and by the IALT study, may be as large as 8-15 percent as indicated by more recent studies with modern platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.

These include selective cytokine inhibitory drugs (SelCIDs), with greatly improved TNF-alpha inhibitory activity, and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) that are structural analogs of thalidomide, with improved properties. A third group recently identified within the SelCID group, with phosphodiesterase type 4-independent activity, is in the process of being characterized in laboratory studies. This review describes the emerging immunological properties of thalidomide, from a historical context to present-day clinical applications, most notably in multiple myeloma but also in other cancers, inflammatory disease, and HIV. We also describe the laboratory studies that have led to the characterization and development of SelCIDs and IMiDs into potentially clinically relevant drugs. Early trial data suggest that these novel immunomodulatory compounds may supercede thalidomide to become established therapies, particularly in certain cancers. Further evidence is required, however, to correlate the clinical efficacy of these compounds with their known immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, and antitumor properties."

During this time its therapeutic efficacy and favorable safety profile have been proven in numerous clinical trails as well as by postmarketing surveillance in accordance with German drug regulations. During recent years, however, several cases of hemorrhage have been reported to occur in coincidence with the use of Ginkgo products. Although a clear causality between Ginkgo intake and bleeding could not be established, these observations have generally been explained by the platelet-activating factor (PAF)-antagonistic action of ginkgolides, which represent characteristic constituents of Ginkgo extracts. PAF was originally characterized by inducing aggregation and secretion of serotonin and histamine from rabbit platelets. We now confirmed that induction of aggregation of human platelets by PAF requires at least 200 times higher concentration when compared to rabbit cells. Under the chosen experimental conditions, PAF-mediated aggregation of human platelets was half-maximally inhibited by ginkgolide B, A, C and J at concentrations of 2.5, 15.8, 29.8 and 43.5 microg/ml, respectively. These concentrations are generally more than 100 times higher as the peak plasma values measured after oral intake of EGb 761 at recommended doses between 120 and 240 mg. As PAF is a 'weak' platelet activator, which does not appear to be of importance for primary hemostasis, our results rise serious doubts that the PAF antagonistic effect of ginkgolides could be responsible for hemorrhage in patients taking EGb 761."

In this study, we examined by confocal microscopy the pancreatic expression of MHC Class I protein, insulin, and ICA 512 protein tyrosine phosphatase in C57BL/Ks mice given 40 mg/kg bw streptozotocin IP on 5 consecutive days. All animals were hyperglycemic from Day 7 and onwards. A loss of ICA 512 from the central portions of the islets was noted on Day 3. On Day 7, an increase in MHC Class I expression, confined primarily to immune cells in the exocrine pancreas and the periinsular areas, was detected. Later, several MHC class I/glucagon and some MHC class I/insulin double-positive cells were found. The insulitis was maximal on Day 14 and declined thereafter. The induction of MHC Class I expression in endocrine cells, occuring only after the cellular infiltration and when the animals were diabetic, indicates that the immune component of the disease does not depend on MHC Class I-restricted cytotoxic T-cells but rather comprises a non-antigen-specific process.

We present herein the first case of SCLE induced by acebutolol. A 57-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of a cutaneous eruption of the photo-exposed areas. One month ago, the patient had started a treatment with oral acebutolol to cure a hypertension of 1-year evolution. Physical examination revealed erythematous scaly annular plaques, involving the face, arms and trunk. Immunologic serology findings revealed a positive titer of antinuclear antibodies up to 1/1,280 with positivity of antihistone and Ro/SSA antibodies. Acebutolol was stopped, and the lesions cleared completely 4 months later. Literature data, along with our case, suggest a link between acebutolol therapy and the onset of a lupus syndrome. Although this is the first report of acebutolol-induced SCLE, we should be aware of this occurrence, and avoidance of acebutolol is recommended in patients with stigmata of lupus erythematosus."

Chronic pulmonary sequelae in response to silicone injection have not been previously described. We report a case of chronic progressive granulomatous pneumonitis in response to subcutaneous silicone injections in a transgender male-to-female patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). After receiving silicone injections to the buttock, the patient developed rapid onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and chills. Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse peripheral interstitial opacities. She responded symptomatically to prednisone with subsequent intermittent symptomatic flares. Four years later, she developed marked dyspnea and cough. Chest computed tomography showed progressive diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities. Lung biopsies demonstrated numerous spheroid silicone particles within the lung interstitium and small pulmonary vessels, surrounded by foreign body giant cells and nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation. We speculate that HIV-1-infected patients may be at risk for chronic, progressive granulomatous pneumonitis due to silicone injection years after their procedure owing to shifting levels of cell-mediated immunity."

True,clear studies others multiple pathways fatty acids palmitate lead betacell dysfunction death nan,19106615,fatty acids,death,"Type 2 diabetes occurs when the endocrine pancreas can no longer secrete enough insulin to maintain glucose and lipid homeostasis. This is likely due to cumulative defects in beta-cell fate and function, as well as insulin resistance. A number of recent studies, including ones from our group, have used unbiased proteomic, genomic and genetic approaches to unravel the mechanisms by which hyperlipidemia causes beta-cell apoptosis and dysfunction. It is clear from these studies and others, that there are multiple pathways by which fatty acids such as palmitate can lead to beta-cell dysfunction and death. In the present article, we highlight the role for dysfunction in the ER and secretory pathway in the toxic effects of free fatty acids. Recent work has shown that the rapid degradation of carboxypeptidase E plays a significant role in beta-cell death in response to the free fatty acid palmitate. These newly identified targets of beta-cell lipotoxicity present novel avenues for research and therapeutic intervention."

In this study naloxone reversed respiratory paralysis induced by thiopental in rats. 25 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate, increased GABA, decreased glutamate, and had no effect on aspartate or glycine levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem. Pretreatment of rats with thiosemicarbazide for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of thiopental. 50 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced respiratory arrest with further increase in GABA and decrease in glutamate again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the amino acids studied in four regions of rat brain. Naloxone (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) reversed respiratory paralysis, glutamate and GABA levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum. These data suggest naloxone reverses respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental and involves GABA in its action."
False,new role (-)-epicatechin enhancing induction growth inhibition apoptosis human lung cancer cells curcumin nan,20606042,curcumin,lung cancer,"Curcumin, a phenolic compound isolated from the plant Curcuma longa (Linn), is ingested every day in the Indian subcontinent and is well reported to possess cancer-preventive activity. To achieve effective cancer prevention with curcumin, we need to find a new method to enhance the effects of curcumin in the diet. Based on our evidence that (-)-epicatechin (EC), an inert catechin, enhances the cancer-preventive activity of green tea catechins, we studied the enhancing effects of EC on inductions of growth inhibition and apoptosis in human lung cancer cell lines PC-9 and A549 with curcumin. The combination of curcumin with EC significantly increased the inhibition of cell growth compared with curcumin or EC alone. The combination similarly increased both apoptosis and expression of GADD153 and GADD45 genes, associated with their enhanced protein production. Knockdown of GADD153 or GADD45 by small interfering RNA abrogated the apoptosis induction and growth inhibition induced by the combination, indicating the crucial role of their upregulation. Treatments of PC-9 cells with c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase inhibitor SP600125, with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB202190 and with PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 inhibitor) all increased the upregulation of GADD153 and GADD45 genes by the combination. Because EC was previously shown to enhance the incorporation of EGCG into PC-9 cells, we think that EC has similar effects on curcumin. This report is the first report on the enhancing effects of EC on curcumin, and the data suggest that EC plays a significant role in the enhancement of the cancer-preventive activity of curcumin in the diet."
True,results indicate cb1093 potentiates responsiveness breast cancer cells tnfalpha suggest ceramide andor cpla might involved downstream effectors vitamin dmediated caspaseindependent cell deathnan,11165041,CB1093,breast cancer,"Mechanisms by which vitamin D analogues promote apoptosis in tumour cells are unclear. In this study we have examined possible interactions between the synthetic vitamin D analogue CB1093 and two other known mediators of apoptosis, TNFalpha and ceramide, in MCF-7, T47D and Hs578T breast cancer cells. These studies indicated that cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) is involved in CB1093 as well as TNFalpha-mediated cell death. CB1093 promoted both TNFalpha and ceramide-induced c-PLA(2) activation, which was inversely related to loss of cell viability in MCF-7 and Hs578T cells. TNFalpha alone (5-20 ng/ml) failed to induce cytotoxicity and activation of cPLA(2) in T47D cells. However, pretreatment of these cells with CB1093 potentiated C(2)-ceramide-induced cPLA(2) activation and cell death. Treatment with CB1093 alone induced loss of cell viability and DNA fragmentation in all three cell lines by 5 days and these effects were accompanied by activation of cPLA(2). Furthermore, co-treatment with the cPLA(2) inhibitor AACOCF(3) led to partial protection against loss of cell viability induced by CB1093 in Hs578T and T47D cells as well as MCF-7 cells. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk prevented TNFalpha but not C(2)-ceramide and CB1093-mediated release of arachidonic acid and cell death in MCF-7 cells. These results indicate that CB1093 potentiates responsiveness of breast cancer cells to TNFalpha and suggest that ceramide and/or cPLA(2) might be involved as downstream effectors in vitamin D-mediated caspase-independent cell death."
True,article provides overview incidence characteristics management mtiassociated neurotoxicities known vinca alkaloids taxanes well newer agents vinflunine ixabepilonenan,18567992,vinflunine,neurotoxicities,"Microtubule inhibitor (MTI)-based chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer--including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones--are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone."

It is widely used by the medical profession as a broad-spectrum antibiotic in the treatment of pneumonia, urinary tract infections and tonsillitis. In addition to its antibiotic properties, azithromycin has immune-modulating effects and is used for this reason in the management of cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. The drug is taken up by neutrophils, macrophages and fibroblasts, and is slowly released by these cells. Three diverse case reports are presented in which a single course of azithromycin (consisting of one 500 mg tablet being taken a day for three days) was prescribed before any periodontal intervention occurred. Azithromycin was the principal mode of treatment of severe chronic and aggressive periodontitis in Cases 1 and 2. Azithromycin, together with monthly subgingival debridement, was the treatment in Case 3 (severe chronic periodontitis in a poorly controlled diabetic complicated by gingival overgrowth related to medication with a calcium channel blocker). Favourable resolution of inflammation, reduction in pocket depths and evidence of bone regeneration were evident, even when no periodontal treatment had occurred. In Case 3, resolution of gingival overgrowth occurred over eight months. The potential implications for periodontal management, understanding of the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases and periodontal research are briefly discussed."

A control group was included for comparison with the lower dose range of glycopyrrolate and atropine. A frequency of bradycardia of 50% was noted in the control group, but this was not significantly different from the frequency with the active drugs. Bradycardia (defined as a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beat min-1) was prevented when the larger dose of either active drug was used. It is recommended that either glycopyrrolate 10 micrograms kg-1 or atropine 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v. should immediately precede induction of anaesthesia, in children, if the repeated administration of suxamethonium is anticipated."

True,mibg also used potential marker pulmonary endothelial cell function may related pulmonary hypertension nan,18471462,MIBG,pulmonary hypertension,"Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) has been used to assess myocardial sympathetic nervous activity and severity of heart failure. (123)I-MIBG is also used as a potential marker of pulmonary endothelial cell function and may be related to pulmonary hypertension. Thus, we hypothesized that combined assessment of lung and heart 123I-MIBG kinetics predicts future clinical outcome more accurately than myocardial evaluation alone in patients with chronic heart failure. To test this hypothesis, we examined 123I-MIBG scintigrams in 62 consecutive patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Anterior planar images were obtained 15 minutes and 3 hours after 123I-MIBG injection. Cardiac and pulmonary 123I-MIBG activities were quantified as heart-to-mediastinum activity ratio and lung-to-mediastinum activity ratio. We introduced lung-to-heart activity ratio as the new 123I-MIBG parameter including myocardial sympathetic nerve activity and pulmonary endothelial cell function. Delayed lung-to-heart ratio was correlated with pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.48, p <0.0001), disease duration (r = 0.49, p <0.0001), and number of heart failure episodes (r = 0.55, p <0.0001). During a mean follow-up of 25 months, 15 patients had a cardiac event. Area under receiver operating characteristic curves for prediction of the event was greatest in delayed lung-to-heart ratio (lung to heart 0.92, heart to mediastinum 0.83, lung to mediastinum 0.80). In multivariate analysis, the lung-to-heart ratio (hazard ratio 2.76/0.1 increase, p = 0.002) was selected as an independent predictor for a future cardiac event. In conclusion, the combined assessment of lung and heart 123I-MIBG uptake may help to predict future clinical outcome for patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy more accurately than myocardial evaluation alone."
True,trials also indicate increased frequencies meconium passage neonatal acidemia cesarean delivery fetal distress women receiving higher doses misoprostol nan,10454679,misoprostol,acidemia,"Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E(1 ) analog, is widely used in the United States for cervical ripening and labor induction. Its use for these indications is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved indication in the product labeling is the treatment and prevention of intestinal ulcer disease resulting from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use. Multiple trials have proved that misoprostol is an effective agent for cervical ripening and labor induction in term pregnancy; however, investigations continue regarding the optimal dose, dosing regimen, and route of administration. Uterine contraction abnormalities are often found in association with higher misoprostol doses. Some trials also indicate increased frequencies of meconium passage, neonatal acidemia, and cesarean delivery for fetal distress in women receiving higher doses of misoprostol. Overall, most trials fail to demonstrate a significant change in the cesarean delivery rate with the use of this agent. Misoprostol is an effective agent for cervical ripening and labor induction when used in a judicious and cautious fashion."

The two treatment regimens were equally efficacious. Nephrotoxicity occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with netilmicin and tobramycin (17% vs 11%). Ototoxicity occurred in four (9.5%) of 42 netilmicin and piperacillin and in 12 (22%) of 54 tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients. Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms, three of four netilmicin and piperacillin-treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients. The number of greater than or equal to 15-dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15-dB changes (increases and decreases) was significantly lower in netilmicin and piperacillin- vs tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients (18 of 78 vs 67 of 115). We conclude that aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity was less severe and more often reversible with netilmicin than with tobramycin."

True,based experimental studies substantial amounts ascorbic acid would need administered preferably parenterally soon exposure prevent systemic toxicity chromium(vi) humansnan,10382555,chromium(VI),toxicity,"Repeated topical exposure to chromium(VI) may cause an allergic contact dermatitis or the formation of chrome ulcers. Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III)."
False,conclude administration metolazone furosemide enhances diuresis natriuresis chloruresis overcomes rapid development tolerance furosemide infants bronchopulmonary dysplasia blocking compensatory increase renal sodium chloride absorptionnandisease preexisting condition,1593359,sodium,bronchopulmonary dysplasia,"A decreased response to the loop diuretic furosemide develops within a few doses in young infants. We tested the hypothesis that the use of the thiazide-like diuretic metolazone, in combination with furosemide, would inhibit water and electrolyte reabsorption and overcome pharmacologic tolerance to furosemide alone. Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia of similar gestational and postnatal ages were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 (n = 6) received furosemide (1 mg/kg per dose) intravenously every 24 hours for a total of five doses. Group 2 (n = 8) received the same treatment as group 1, but in addition metolazone (0.2 mg/kg per dose) was given enterally with doses 3 and 4 of furosemide. Group 3 (n = 8) received metolazone (0.2 mg/kg per dose) enterally every 24 hours for five doses. Urine was collected before the first diuretic dose and throughout the study for determination of the urine flow rate; urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and potassium; and creatinine clearance. Urinary flow rate and urinary sodium and chloride excretion increased after the first dose in all groups. In the infants treated with either furosemide or metolazone, urinary flow rate and urinary and chloride excretion returned to baseline values after the last three doses. In contrast, when furosemide was administered with metolazone, urinary flow rate and urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and potassium were greater than the values for baseline and for the previous dose, as well as for the corresponding doses of furosemide in group 1 and metolazone in group 3. Tolerance to furosemide (group 1) and metolazone (group 3) appeared to be explained by compensatory increased sodium and chloride reabsorption without changes in creatinine clearance. We conclude that the administration of metolazone with furosemide enhances diuresis, natriuresis, and chloruresis and overcomes the rapid development of tolerance to furosemide in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia by blocking the compensatory increase in renal sodium and chloride absorption."

Histologically, the myocardial lesions resembled those found in human anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. 1 of the 10 monkeys developed acute myeloblastic leukemia after receiving 324 mg/m2 of adriamycin; the 10th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of drug. Our results suggest that adriamycin is a more potent cardiotoxin in monkeys than in man, and that leukemia may be a consequence of prolonged treatment with this drug."
True,sixty percent males developed breast changes impotence taking cimetidine cases changes disappeared cimetidine replaced ranitidinenanside effect,6150641,cimetidine,impotence,"The H2-histamine receptor antagonists ranitidine and cimetidine were compared for their abilities to control gastric acid hypersecretion on a short- and long-term basis in 22 patients with gastric acid hypersecretory states. Nineteen patients had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, one patient had systemic mastocytosis, and two patients had idiopathic hypersecretion. The rates of onset of the action of cimetidine and ranitidine were the same. The actions of both drugs were increased by anticholinergic agents, and there was a close correlation between the daily maintenance dose of each drug needed to control acid secretion. However, ranitidine was threefold more potent than cimetidine both in acute inhibition studies and in the median maintenance dose needed (1.2 g per day for ranitidine and 3.6 g per day for cimetidine). Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or impotence while taking cimetidine and in all cases these changes disappeared when cimetidine was replaced by ranitidine. Treatment with high doses of cimetidine (one to 60 months; median, 11 months) or ranitidine (two to 31 months; median, 14 months) was not associated with hepatic or hematologic toxicity or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations, but ranitidine therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum creatinine level than seen with cimetidine therapy. The results show that both drugs can adequately inhibit acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states. Both are safe at high doses, but ranitidine is threefold more potent and does not cause the antiandrogen side effects frequently seen with high doses of cimetidine."

Its toxicity is due to interference with oxidative phosphorylation. Acute and chronic poisoning may occur by dermal absorption, inhalation or ingestion. Chronic poisoning occurs mainly in sawmill workers or people living in log homes treated with PCP-containing wood protecting formulations. Quantitative determination of PCP in urine and serum is useful to detect occupational or subclinical exposure. The clinical features of acute and chronic PCP poisoning can be classified systematically into effects on the skin, metabolism (fever), the haematopoietic tissue, the respiratory system, the central and peripheral nervous system, the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract. Although PCP is not classified as a human carcinogen, some epidemiological observations suggest that exposure to chlorophenols in general and PCP solutions in particular may result in an increased risk for certain malignant disorders such as nasal carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma. There is concern that contamination of PCP-solutions with products such as chlorodibenzo-p-dioxins is the real cause of this suspected carcinogenicity. No specific antidote exists for the treatment of (acute) PCP poisoning. The basis of the treatment of acute poisoning is intensive supportive care with prevention of dangerous rise in temperature. Use of PCP-based products as indoor wood preservatives poses an unacceptable risk to human health."

False,aimed investigate use oral simvastatin mg individuals relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis nan,15145635,simvastatin,multiple sclerosis,"Many drugs have been approved for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis but are only partly effective, are injected, and are expensive. We aimed to investigate use of of oral simvastatin (80 mg) in 30 individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The mean number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions at months 4, 5, and 6 of treatment was compared with the mean number of lesions noted on pretreatment brain MRI scans. Number and volume of Gd-enhancing lesions declined by 44%, (p<0.0001) and 41% (p=0.0018), respectively. Treatment was well tolerated. Oral simvastatin might inhibit inflammatory components of multiple sclerosis that lead to neurological disability."
False,ketanserin pretreatment reverses alfentanilinduced muscle rigidity nan,3115150,Ketanserin,muscle rigidity,"Systemic pretreatment with ketanserin, a relatively specific type-2 serotonin receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the muscle rigidity produced in rats by the potent short-acting opiate agonist alfentanil. Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal's left gastrocnemius muscle, rigidity was assessed by analyzing root-mean-square electromyographic activity. Intraperitoneal ketanserin administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg prevented the alfentanil-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline. Chlordiazepoxide at doses up to 10 mg/kg failed to significantly influence the rigidity produced by alfentanil. Despite the absence of rigidity, animals that received ketanserin (greater than 0.31 mg/kg i.p.) followed by alfentanil were motionless, flaccid, and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving alfentanil alone. Rats that received ketanserin and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received ketanserin alone. These results, in combination with previous work, suggest that muscle rigidity, a clinically relevant side-effect of parenteral narcotic administration, may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways. Pretreatment with type-2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate-induced rigidity, although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS, cardiovascular, and respiratory depression."
True,one patients developed cardiac failure mg mmc mg doxorubicin nan,3137399,doxorubicin,cardiac failure,"Since 1975 mitomycin C (MMC) has been suggested to be cardiotoxic, especially when combined with or given following doxorubicin. Data on dose dependency or incidence concerning this side effect were not known. We have initiated a prospective study to obtain some more data on these subjects. Forty-four MMC-treated patients were studied, 37 of them could be evaluated. All patients were studied by repeated physical examinations, chest X-rays, electro- and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) determinations. The results were evaluated per cumulative dose level. One of the patients developed cardiac failure after 30 mg m-2 MMC and only 150 mg m-2 doxorubicin. The cardiac failure was predicted by a drop in EF determined during a cold pressor test. None of the other patients developed clinical cardiotoxicity, nor did the studied parameters change. The literature on this subject was also reviewed. Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature, we suggest that MMC-related cardiotoxicity is dose dependent, occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m-2 or more, mainly in patients also (previously or simultaneously) treated with doxorubicin. The incidence is likely to be less than 10% even for this risk group."

False,find clinically achievable levels 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine azadc potent inhibitor dna methylation modify chromatin restore ability tumor necrosis factor alpha tnfalpha induce monocytic differentiation acute myeloid leukemia cells nbnan,19117987,5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine,acute myeloid leukemia,"Transcriptional silencing via promoter methylation of genes important for cell growth and differentiation plays a key role in myeloid leukemogenesis. We find that clinically achievable levels of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC), a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation, can modify chromatin and restore the ability of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) to induce monocytic differentiation of the acute myeloid leukemia cells NB4 and U937. Although 5-AZA-dC cannot fully induce differentiation, we show that 5-AZA-dC acts directly on TNFalpha-responsive promoters to facilitate TNFalpha-induced transcriptional pathways leading to differentiation. 5-AZA-dC regulates the expression of Dif-2, a TNFalpha target gene, by deacetylating chromatin domains in a methylation-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of the Dif-2 promoter show histone hyperacetylation and a recruitment of the nuclear factor-kappaB transcription factor in response to 5-AZA-dC. Furthermore, 5-AZA-dC plus TNFalpha enhances the level of phosphorylated RNA Pol II at the Dif-2 promoter via synergistic recruitment of TFIIH. We conclude that nonspecific changes in chromatin can allow a specific transcriptional inducer to overcome blocks in leukemic cell differentiation. Our results support the concept of low doses of 5-AZA-dC acting in combination with other agents to target epigenetic changes that drive malignant growth in leukemic cells.

All isolates manifested the Van A phenotype. Extensive environmental contamination with VRE was present. PFGE of E. faecium isolates from 10 patients and from five of six environmental cultures revealed patterns suggesting genetic relatedness. Following comparison of the 14 cases with 41 controls matched for age (+/- 4 years) and cohabitation on the oncology unit, risk factors for colonisation with VRE included duration of neutropenia, (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.0-13.1), and antibiotic therapy, (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.08-15.3), the number of antibiotic agents received, (OR, 8.4; 95% CI, 1.34-34.3) and the duration of therapy with amikacin, (OR, 10.7; 95% CI, 1.4-81.5), ceftazidime, (OR, 11.5; 95% CI, 2.2 59.9) or teicoplanin, (OR, 12.3; 95% CI, 2.25-67.4).

In two large (both n = 480), well designed, 3-week trials in adult patients with bipolar I disorder, asenapine monotherapy was significantly more effective than placebo at improving mania symptoms, as assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale total score (YMRS; primary endpoint), with significant differences between the asenapine and placebo groups occurring after 2 days of treatment. In both trials, Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) scale mania severity scores exceeded those of placebo. In one trial, response and remission rates exceeded those of placebo. In a 9-week extension study that recruited completers from the monotherapy trials, there were no significant differences between asenapine and olanzapine groups in terms in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, CGI-BP mania severity scores, YMRS response rates or YMRS remission rates during the extension phase. In the extension study, the efficacy of asenapine monotherapy appeared to be maintained over 40 weeks (total treatment duration of 52 weeks). In a 12-week trial of asenapine as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate, asenapine was more effective than placebo in improving manic symptoms, based on the difference between groups in the YMRS total score at week 3 (primary endpoint). Most adverse events associated with asenapine were of mild to moderate severity, with <7% of asenapine recipients experiencing serious adverse events (vs 7% with placebo). In a pooled analysis of the monotherapy trials, the most common adverse events (occurring in ≥ 5% of patients and at twice the incidence of placebo) reported during acute phase asenapine monotherapy for bipolar mania were somnolence, dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS, other than akathisia) and increased bodyweight, which were similar in nature to those occurring during longer-term monotherapy with asenapine. EPS did not worsen in severity during longer-term asenapine monotherapy. Asenapine had minimal effects on plasma glucose, lipid and prolactin levels over both short- and longer-term treatment periods, and had little pro-arrhythmogenic potential. Further active comparator trials and longer-term tolerability and safety data are required. In the meantime, asenapine is a further option for the management of manic and/or mixed symptoms in patients with bipolar I disorder and may be of particular value for patients who are at high risk for metabolic abnormalities."

True,although pcp classified human carcinogen epidemiological observations suggest exposure chlorophenols general pcp solutions particular may result increased risk certain malignant disorders nasal carcinoma soft tissue sarcomanan,7904464,PCP,nasal carcinoma,"Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was, and still is, one of the most frequently used fungicides and pesticides. Its toxicity is due to interference with oxidative phosphorylation. Acute and chronic poisoning may occur by dermal absorption, inhalation or ingestion. Chronic poisoning occurs mainly in sawmill workers or people living in log homes treated with PCP-containing wood protecting formulations. Quantitative determination of PCP in urine and serum is useful to detect occupational or subclinical exposure. The clinical features of acute and chronic PCP poisoning can be classified systematically into effects on the skin, metabolism (fever), the haematopoietic tissue, the respiratory system, the central and peripheral nervous system, the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract. Although PCP is not classified as a human carcinogen, some epidemiological observations suggest that exposure to chlorophenols in general and PCP solutions in particular may result in an increased risk for certain malignant disorders such as nasal carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma. There is concern that contamination of PCP-solutions with products such as chlorodibenzo-p-dioxins is the real cause of this suspected carcinogenicity. No specific antidote exists for the treatment of (acute) PCP poisoning. The basis of the treatment of acute poisoning is intensive supportive care with prevention of dangerous rise in temperature. Use of PCP-based products as indoor wood preservatives poses an unacceptable risk to human health."
True,tacrine administered licl pretreated rats induces electrocorticographic seizures delayed hippocampal damagenan,19944736,Tacrine,seizures,"The purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound. A Tween 80-coated poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system, able to trespass the BBB. Tacrine, administered in LiCl pre-treated rats, induces electrocorticographic seizures and delayed hippocampal damage. The toxic effects of tacrine-loaded poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles (5mg/kg), a saline solution of tacrine (5mg/kg) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i.p. administration in LiCl-pre-treated Wistar rats. All the animals treated with tacrine-loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms, i.e. epileptic onset, with respect to those animals treated with the free compound (10 min vs. 22 min respectively). In addition, tacrine-loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage of neuronal cells in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals, while the saline solution of tacrine only in 60% of animals. Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control (saline-treated) group of animals. In conclusion, the evaluation of time-to-onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the tacrine-lithium model of epilepsy in the rat, could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass (or not) the BBB in vivo."

Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."

In vivo these substances significantly reduced the weight of neuroblastoma tumour transplants in the mice (nude/nude) (P less than 0.05). A dose/effect relationship could be established. In vitro, the D50 was determined, using fibroblasts as controls. The growth of neuroblastoma tumours was inhibited by different mechanisms: L-dopa and its metabolite dopamine reduced the activity of tyrosinase, BSO reduced glutathione levels, and L-dopa and tamoxifen raised cAMP concentrations."
True,nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors human immunodeficiency virus proteins cause axonal injury human dorsal root ganglia culturesnan,17505984,Nucleoside,axonal injury,"Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) has emerged as the most common complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which is associated with neuronal injury in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, especially nucleoside analogs, patients are living longer. Some of the antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV infection have been associated with neuropathies. The pathogenesis of these neuropathies remains poorly understood. Utilizing a human fetal DRG model of predominantly nociceptive fibers, the authors investigated the effects of HIV gp120 and Tat(1-72), alone or in combination with nucleoside analogs on both morphological and ultra-structural changes in DRG neurons. Nucleoside analogs and HIV proteins both caused a significant decrease in the mean axonal length. However, ddI was the most potent, followed by ddC, d4T, and AZT. Despite the combined exposure to toxic dosages of HIV proteins and nucleoside analogs, there appeared to be a ceiling effect on the amount of axonal retraction, indicating that the proximal and distal axon are differentially regulated. In conclusion, both HIV proteins and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) cause axonal damage by inducing mitochondrial injury and rearrangement of microtubules."

True,death worst outcome gi complications low dose asa users data aspect scarcenan,22542152,ASA,GI complications,"Low dose aspirin (ASA) use has been associated with a wide range of adverse side effects in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which range from troublesome symptoms without mucosal lesions to more serious toxicity, including ulcers, GI bleeding, perforation and even death. Upper GI symptoms in low dose ASA users are common but often careless or misinterpreted and they are not always related to the presence of mucosal injury. Usually, low dose ASA related ulcers are reasonably small and asymptomatic, and probably heal over a period of weeks to a few months. But, the real clinical problem occurs when the ulcer results in a GI complication (mostly bleeding). The estimated average excess risk of symptomatic or complicated ulcer related to low dose ASA is five cases per 1000 ASA users per year. Death is the worst outcome of GI complications in low dose ASA users, but data about this aspect are scarce. Current evidence indicates that low dose ASA can damage the lower GI tract also, but the real size of the problem is still unknown."
False,aim study test fluticasone propionate fp efficacy treatment patients bronchial asthma ba controlled high doses mg inhaled corticosteroids nan,10660975,corticosteroids,bronchial asthma/BA,"The aim of the study was to test the fluticasone propionate (FP) efficacy in the treatment of patients with bronchial asthma (BA), not controlled by high doses (more than 1 mg) of other inhaled corticosteroids. Asthma symptoms (degree of dyspnea on Sadoul scale, percentage of symptom-free days and nights), and drug consumption were measured and lung function tests were performed in 20 patients (11 women and 9 men, mean age 47 years) for a 2 months period. Biochemical measurements were done referring to oxidant/antioxidant imbalance, which is characteristic to inflammatory diseases of respiratory system. We evaluated lipoperoxidation (LPO) in the plasma and the blood, before and after FP treatment, by determining malondialdehyde (MDA) status, superoxide-dismutase and ceruloplasmine activity and non-protein SH groups (essential glutathione) status. The biochemical measurements showed a significant decrease in lipid peroxides level in the plasma and the blood and a slight increase of glutathione after 2 months treatment with FP. Lung function tests were performed on a Flow Streen Jaeger and we determined: peak expiratory flow (PEF), vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec. (FEV1) and mid-expiratory flow at 50% VC (MEF50). The measurements were done before FP administration, after 3 days, 7 days, 1 month and 2 months. The dose of FP was equivalent to 50-75% of the daily dose of Beclomethasone dipropionate (BD) previously administered. The degree of dyspnea diminished from 3-4 to 0-1. The percentage of symptom-free days and nights improved from 12% to 78% and 25% to 95% respectively. The use of short acting beta agonists diminished with 75% and no patients required i.v. corticotherapy or theophylline. PEF increased with a mean of 25%, VC with a mean of 23%, FEV1 with a mean of 30% and MEF50 with a mean of 36%. Our results demonstrate improved efficacy of FP vs high doses of other inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of moderate persistent and severe forms of BA."
True,children diphenhydramine hydroxyzine effective hreceptor antagonists medications cause cns dysfunction evidenced increased latency measure cognitive function increased subjective somnolencenan,8792380,hydroxyzine,CNS dysfunction,"Although older, potentially sedating, ""first-generation"" antihistamines (H1-receptor antagonists) are commonly used in childhood, their central nervous system (CNS) effects have not been well-documented in young subjects. We hypothesized that diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine would affect CNS function adversely in this population. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of these medications on central and peripheral histamine H1-receptors in children. Fifteen subjects with allergic rhinitis were tested before and 2-2.5 h after administration of diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, or placebo in a double-blind, single-dose, three-way crossover study. Impairment of cognitive processing was assessed objectively by the latency of the P300 event-related potential (P300). Somnolence was assessed subjectively by a visual analog scale. Peripheral H1-blockade was assessed by suppression of the histamine-induced wheals and flares. At the central (Cz) and frontal (Fz) electrodes, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine increased the P300 latency significantly (P < 0.05) compared to baseline. Hydroxyzine increased somnolence, as recorded on the visual analog scale, significantly compared to baseline (P < 0.05), with a similar trend for diphenhydramine (P = 0.07). Both antihistamines reduced histamine-induced wheals and flares significantly compared to baseline and compared to placebo. In children, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine are effective H1-receptor antagonists, but both these medications cause CNS dysfunction, as evidenced by increased P300 latency, a measure of cognitive function, and by increased subjective somnolence."

Nine out of 17 patients were diagnosed with high-probability AMR-IP (HP-AMR-IP) by four experts, and three separate observers. Bronchoalveolar lavage findings did not differ between HP-AMR-IP and low-probability AMR-IP (LP-AMR-IP) patients. In HP-AMR-IP patients, pCLE showed large (>20 μm) and strongly fluorescent cells in 32 out of 38 alveolar areas. In contrast, these cells were observed in only two out of 39 areas from LP-AMR-IP patients, in one out of 59 areas from ILD patients not receiving amiodarone and in none of the 10 areas from amiodarone-treated patients without ILD (p<0.001; HP-AMR-IP versus other groups). The presence of at least one alveolar area with large and fluorescent cells had a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value for the diagnosis of AMR-IP of 100%, 88%, 100% and 90%, respectively. In conclusion, pCLE appears to be a valuable tool for the in vivo diagnosis of AMR-IP in subacute ILD patients. "

False,compared oral opioids advantages transdermal fentanyl include lower incidence impact adverse effects constipation nausea vomiting daytime drowsiness higher degree patient satisfaction improved quality life improved convenience compliance resulting administration every hours decreased use rescue medicationnan,14583070,fentanyl,nausea,"Transdermal fentanyl is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of chronic pain caused by malignancy and non-malignant conditions when administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Compared with oral opioids, the advantages of transdermal fentanyl include a lower incidence and impact of adverse effects (constipation, nausea and vomiting, and daytime drowsiness), a higher degree of patient satisfaction, improved quality of life, improved convenience and compliance resulting from administration every 72 hours, and decreased use of rescue medication. Transdermal fentanyl is a useful analgesic for cancer patients who are unable to swallow or have gastrointestinal problems. Transdermal fentanyl forms a depot within the upper skin layers before entering the microcirculation. Therapeutic blood levels are attained 12-16 hours after patch application and decrease slowly with a half-life of 16-22 hours following removal. Patients with chronic pain should be titrated to adequate relief with short-acting oral or parenteral opioids prior to the initiation of transdermal fentanyl in order to prevent exacerbations of pain or opioid-related adverse effects. Transdermal fentanyl can then be initiated based on the 24-hour opioid requirement once adequate analgesia has been achieved. The prolonged elimination of transdermal fentanyl can become problematic if patients develop opioid-related adverse effects, especially hypoventilation. Adverse effects do not improve immediately after patch removal and may take many hours to resolve. Patients who experience opioid-related toxicity associated with respiratory depression should be treated immediately with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone and closely monitored for at least 24 hours. Because of the short half-life of naloxone, sequential doses or a continuous infusion of the opioid antagonist may be necessary. Transdermal fentanyl should be administered cautiously to patients with pre-existing conditions such as emphysema that may predispose them to the development of hypoventilation. Transdermal fentanyl is indicated only for patients who require continuous opioid administration for the treatment of chronic pain that cannot be managed with other medications. It is contraindicated in the management of acute and postoperative pain, as pain may decrease more rapidly in these circumstances than fentanyl blood levels can be adjusted, leading to the development of life-threatening hypoventilation. Cognitive and physical impairments such as confusion and abnormal co-ordination can occur with transdermal fentanyl. Therefore, patients should be instructed to refrain from driving or operating machinery immediately following the initiation of transdermal fentanyl, or after any dosage increase. Patients may resume such activities once the absence of these potential adverse effects is documented."
True,strongly suspect lethal anuria mainly due ifosfamide occurring patient received previous cisplatin chemotherapy poor kidney perfusion due transient hypotensionnan,2320800,ifosfamide,anuria,"A sixty-year-old woman with advanced breast cancer, previously treated with cisplatin, developed an irreversible lethal renal failure with anuria, the day after 5 g/m2 bolus ifosfamide. Postrenal failure was excluded by echography. A prerenal component could have contributed to renal failure because of a transient hypotension, due to an increasing ascitis, occurring just before anuria. However, correction of the hemodynamic parameters did not improve renal function. Ifosfamide is a known nephrotoxic drug with demonstrated tubulopathies. We strongly suspect that this lethal anuria was mainly due to ifosfamide, occurring in a patient having received previous cisplatin chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient hypotension. We recommend careful use of ifosfamide in patients pretreated with nephrotoxic chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion."
True,adriamycin adr potent anticancer drug known cause severe cardiac toxicity nan,8787689,ADR/Adriamycin,cardiac toxicity,"Adriamycin (ADR) is a potent anticancer drug known to cause severe cardiac toxicity. Although ADR generates free radicals, the role of free radicals in the development of cardiac toxicity and the intracellular target for ADR-induced cardiac toxicity are still not well understood. We produced three transgenic mice lines expressing increased levels of human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial enzyme, as an animal model to investigate the role of ADR-mediated free radical generation in mitochondria. The human MnSOD was expressed, functionally active, and properly transported into mitochondria in the heart of transgenic mice. The levels of copper-zinc SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase did not change in the transgenic mice. Electron microscopy revealed dose-dependent ultrastructural alterations with marked mitochondrial damage in nontransgenic mice treated with ADR, but not in the transgenic littermates. Biochemical analysis indicated that the levels of serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in ADR-treated mice were significantly greater in nontransgenic than their transgenic littermates expressing a high level of human MnSOD after ADR treatment. These results support a major role for free radical generation in ADR toxicity as well as suggesting mitochondria as the critical site of cardiac injury."

As reported by Lee et al. (Calcif Tissue Int 86:132-41, 2010), levodopa intake is associated with increased homocysteinemia that is known to be linked to poorer bone quality and, consequently, osteoporotic fractures. Herein, we report the case of a young woman who suffered recurrent metatarsal fractures in the context of levodopa-treated early-onset Parkinson's disease."
False,suggested tardive cervical dystonia may clinically indistinguishable idiopathic form diagnosis rests solely documenting exposure dopamine antagonist medicationsnan,9613742,dopamine,dystonia,"It has been suggested that tardive cervical dystonia may be clinically indistinguishable from the idiopathic form and that the diagnosis rests solely on documenting an exposure to dopamine antagonist medications. To investigate this, we performed a retrospective evaluation of patient records on 102 patients with idiopathic and 20 patients with tardive cervical dystonia seen in our Movement Disorder Clinic over the past 8 years. Several clinical and demographic variables were compared and a number of differences were observed. The presence of extracervical involvement, retrocollis, and spasmodic head movements were individually found to be predictive of tardive cervical dystonia. Torticollis, laterocollis, and trick maneuvers were predictive of idiopathic cervical dystonia. Head tremor (42.2%) and family history of dystonia (9.8%) were present only in the idiopathic group. Cervical muscle hypertrophy was significantly more common in the idiopathic group (100% versus 75%). No difference was found between the two groups in their response to treatment with botulinum toxin A. These results indicate that clinical differences between idiopathic and tardive cervical dystonia exist. These differences may help to distinguish them in the clinical setting, improve diagnostic accuracy, and support the existence of a causal relationship between exposure to dopamine antagonist medications and chronic dystonia."
False,metformin use among individuals risk type diabetesnan,22399368,Metformin,type,"Excess total and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain very high among those with type 2 diabetes versus those without diabetes. Clinical trials to lower blood glucose have been disappointing probably because the participants were too late in the natural history of diabetes and already had extensive vascular disease. Insulin resistance measured simply by elevated fasting blood insulin is an early marker of β-cell stress and peripheral insulin resistance. Metformin will prevent development of diabetes among patients with impaired fasting glucose but only for the short term. Metformin reduces risk of coronary heart disease. The drug is safe, low cost, and may also prevent cancer. The combination of diet and exercise followed by metformin in the early phase of ""insulin resistance"" may reduce or delay both atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis complications associated with diabetes. Preventive therapy must begin much earlier than before clinical diagnosis of diabetes and aim to initially lower blood insulin levels or insulin resistance."
True,patients hc cyclophosphamide ifosfamide negative bacterial cultures studied bkvnan,17805036,cyclophosphamide,HC,"Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a known complication of oxazophosphorine chemotherapy. BK virus (BKV) has been commonly found to be associated with hematuria in stem cell transplant patients; however, it has rarely been reported after cyclophosphamide chemotherapy alone. The authors present 3 cases of BK viruria with HC in nontransplant pediatric oncology patients. The 3 patients with BKV had more prolonged hematuria (14 to 16 wk) compared with 1 patient with BKV-negative HC (10 wk). The HC necessitated chemotherapy delays and also prolonged supportive care. One patient was treated with intravenous cidofovir with resolution of BK viruria and hematuria. BKV may have an association with the development of HC in nonstem cell transplant patients receiving high-dose oxazophosphorine chemotherapy. HC may present early and be more prolonged in patients with BK viruria. Patients with HC after cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide with negative bacterial cultures should be studied for BKV. Cidofovir may be beneficial in certain patients with BK viruria and HC; however, definitive data will require a clinical trial."

True,results demonstrate 12(s)-hete shete activates erk fak signalling pathways thereby upregulates adhesion metastatic potential melanoma cellsnan,23664097,12(S)-HETE,adhesion,"12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) is a non-haeme iron-containing dioxygenase that forms 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) or 15(S)-HETE. Several biological mediators including cytokines, growth factors and lipid metabolites released during tumour cell-endothelial cell adhesion are associated with malignant tumour progression. Here we found that HETEs released from the host organ played a critical role in tumour metastasis. Intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma cells caused lung nodule formation, which was markedly attenuated in 12/15-LOX null mice. Co-injection of melanoma cells with 12(S)-HETE increased the lung homing activity of B16F10 melanoma cells. In vitro studies showed that 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent increase of adhesion of B16F10 cells on collagen or fibronectin. The melanoma cell adhesion was then evaluated in pulmonary primary cell culture isolated from wild-type (WT) and 12/15-LOX knockout (KO) mice. It was found that the adhesion of melanoma cells on the epithelial cells isolated from 12/15-LOX null mice was reduced in comparison with those isolated from WT mice. Treatment of 12(S)-HETE increased the pFAK in melanoma cells adhering on collagen-coated slide. The enhancement of adherence elicited by 12(S)-HETE in B16F10 cells could be antagonised by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor 14 (FAK inhibitor) or PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor). 12(S)-HETE increased the phosphorylation of FAK and ERK in adhering melanoma cells. The FAK phosphorylation induced by 12(S)-HETE was further inhibited by PD98059, indicating that FAK is the downstream target of ERK. The adhesion and lung metastasis of human melanoma cells of C32 in NOD/SCID mice were also potentiated by co-treatment with 12(S)-HETE. These results demonstrate that 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE activates ERK and FAK signalling pathways, thereby upregulates the adhesion and metastatic potential of melanoma cells. The endogenous release of 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE in the host organ may affect the metastatic potential of melanoma. "
True,relationships plasma baseline predrug gaba concentrations cognitive impairments induced acute oral dose lorazepam  mg investigated healthy elderly individualsnan,15672555,lorazepam,cognitive impairments,"The GABA system is an active target for drugs to treat a variety of disorders and the availability of an indirect measure of central GABA activity would not only enhance psychiatric research, but also permit assessment of the pharmacodynamic effects of drugs designed to act on this system. The relationships between plasma baseline pre-drug GABA concentrations and cognitive impairments induced by an acute oral dose of lorazepam (0.5 and 1.0 mg) were investigated in 22 healthy elderly individuals. Partial correlations controlling for plasma lorazepam concentrations revealed no significant relationship between baseline plasma GABA levels and lorazepam-induced impairments on tests of cognitive functioning. Plasma GABA concentration does not appear to be a useful marker of susceptibility to benzodiazepine-induced cognitive toxicity in the elderly. Other approaches to estimating central GABA activity should be pursued."

In a pivotal phase III trial in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma that had progressed despite first-line therapy, axitinib 5 mg twice daily significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (primary endpoint) compared with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. A significant between-group difference favouring axitinib over sorafenib in terms of progression-free survival was maintained in the subgroups of patients who had previously received cytokine or sunitinib therapy. However, median overall survival was not significantly different between the treatment groups. Significantly more axitinib than sorafenib recipients achieved an objective response, and axitinib therapy significantly prolonged time to deterioration (a composite endpoint of death, disease progression and symptom worsening) relative to sorafenib therapy. While its tolerability profile was generally consistent with that of other VEGF receptor inhibitors, axitinib was associated with a numerically lower incidence of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia, cutaneous toxicity and anaemia than sorafenib in the phase III trial."
False,erlotinib epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor egfrtki recently approved pancreatic cancer treatment reliable predictors patient responsenan,17457047,tyrosine,pancreatic cancer,"Abnormal expression and signaling of ErbB receptors has been implicated in multiple epithelial malignancies, including pancreatic cancer. Erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has been recently approved for pancreatic cancer treatment, but there are no reliable predictors of patient response. Expression of additional ErbB receptors seems to influence tumor response to EGFR-targeted therapy. We analyzed the influence of ErbB3 expression on pancreatic cancer cell response to erlotinib treatment. Proliferation assays of five human pancreatic cancer cell lines were performed following treatment with erlotinib. Expression and phosphorylation profiles of ErbB receptors and downstream adaptor protein (Akt, ERK1/2, STAT3, mTOR) were evaluated following stimulation with EGF or neuregulin-beta. The formation of EGFR homodimers and EGFR-ErbB3 heterodimers, necessary to enable ErbB3 downstream signaling, was demonstrated by chemical cross-linking assays. The effects of RNA inhibition of ErbB3 on sensitivity to erlotinib treatment were evaluated in AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells. Erlotinib inhibited Akt phosphorylation and proliferation of all the ErbB3-expressing cell lines but did not affect mTOR activation. Cross-linking studies confirmed the presence of EGFR-ErbB3 heterodimers in pancreatic cancer cells. Only the ErbB3-deficient MIA PaCa-2 cells displayed persistent Akt activation and ongoing proliferation in spite of erlotinib treatment. siRNA-mediated inhibition of ErbB3 expression in AsPC-1 cells resulted in acquired resistance to erlotinib treatment. Pancreatic cancer cells which lack ErbB3 do not display activation of the ErbB3-PI3K-Akt cascade induced by EGFR/ErbB3 heterodimers and become less critically dependent on EGFR signaling and therefore resistant to erlotinib. Pancreatic cancer expression of ErbB3 may be useful for EGFR-targeted therapy patient selection."
True,conclusion hiv proteins nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrtis cause axonal damage inducing mitochondrial injury rearrangement microtubulesnan,17505984,nucleoside,axonal damage,"Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) has emerged as the most common complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which is associated with neuronal injury in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, especially nucleoside analogs, patients are living longer. Some of the antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV infection have been associated with neuropathies. The pathogenesis of these neuropathies remains poorly understood. Utilizing a human fetal DRG model of predominantly nociceptive fibers, the authors investigated the effects of HIV gp120 and Tat(1-72), alone or in combination with nucleoside analogs on both morphological and ultra-structural changes in DRG neurons. Nucleoside analogs and HIV proteins both caused a significant decrease in the mean axonal length. However, ddI was the most potent, followed by ddC, d4T, and AZT. Despite the combined exposure to toxic dosages of HIV proteins and nucleoside analogs, there appeared to be a ceiling effect on the amount of axonal retraction, indicating that the proximal and distal axon are differentially regulated. In conclusion, both HIV proteins and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) cause axonal damage by inducing mitochondrial injury and rearrangement of microtubules."

One of the most common pulmonary manifestations of RA is rheumatoid nodule. Spontaneous pneumothorax also very rare pulmonary finding and could be associated with pulmonary nodules. Antirheumatic drugs, methotrexate, leflunomide (LEF), infliximab and etanercept, were known as risk factors for developing rheumatoid nodule. However, there was no case report of rheumatoid nodule-associated pneumothorax with the use of LEF. We report, first, herein a case of 46-year-old woman with RA who suffered recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax associated with multiple bilateral subpleural cavitary nodules during treatment with LEF. We reviewed the cases of LEF-related pulmonary nodules developed in patients with RA. Thus, we suggested that pneumothorax can be a rare respiratory fatal complication in patients with RA with pulmonary nodules and LEF can be a rare cause of these manifestations."

In the present study, we investigated whether maltolyl p-coumarate could improve cognitive decline in scopolamine-injected rats and in amyloid beta peptide(1-42)-infused rats. Maltolyl p-coumarate was found to attenuate cognitive deficits in both rat models using passive avoidance test and to reduce apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of the amyloid beta peptide(1-42)-infused rats. We also examined the neuroprotective effects of maltolyl p-coumarate in vitro using SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were pretreated with maltolyl p-coumarate, before exposed to amyloid beta peptide(1-42), glutamate or H2O2. We found that maltolyl p-coumarate significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activation. Taking these in vitro and in vivo results together, our study suggests that maltolyl p-coumarate is a potentially effective candidate against Alzheimer's disease that is characterized by wide spread neuronal death and progressive decline of cognitive function."

True,presence pdea striatal output pathways may reduce incidence severity dopamine receptor antagonistlike side effects including extrapyramidal symptoms nan,17263185,dopamine,extrapyramidal symptoms,"A disruption of corticostriatal signaling is believed to underlie the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia and also contribute to many of the cognitive deficits associated with this disorder. Phosphodiesterase (PDE)10A is a dual substrate PDE highly expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons. Biochemical and behavioral studies indicate that the inhibition of PDE10A enhances striatal output by increasing activity in the cGMP and cAMP signaling pathways. PDE10A inhibitors reduce exploratory activity and antagonize the stimulant response to both amphetamine and N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonists such as phencyclidine. Consistent with their potential as antipsychotic agents, PDE10A inhibitors are potent antagonists of conditioned avoidance responding. The presence of PDE10A in both striatal output pathways may reduce the incidence and severity of dopamine D2 receptor antagonist-like side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms. In addition, by enhancing corticostriatal signaling, PDE10A inhibitors have the potential to improve some of the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia."

However, it accounts for 10% to 25% of all geriatric patients with mood disorders and 5% of patients admitted to geropsychiatric inpatient units. These patients often present a tremendous treatment challenge to clinicians. They frequently have differing treatment needs compared with their younger counterparts because of substantial medical comorbidity and age-related variations in response to therapy. Unfortunately, the management of geriatric bipolar disorder has been relatively neglected compared with the younger population. There continues to be a scarcity of published, controlled trials in the elderly, and no treatment algorithms specific to bipolar disorder in the elderly have been devised."
True,cardiac cns toxicity levobupivacaine strengths evidence advantage bupivacainenan,11945112,levobupivacaine,toxicity,"Bupivacaine is currently the most widely used long-acting local anaesthetic. Its uses include surgery and obstetrics; however, it has been associated with potentially fatal cardiotoxicity, particularly when given intravascularly by accident. Levobupivacaine, a single enantiomer of bupivacaine, has recently been introduced as a new long-acting local anaesthetic with a potentially reduced toxicity compared with bupivacaine. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have compared levobupivacaine with bupivacaine and in most but not all studies there is evidence that levobupivacaine is less toxic. Advantages for levobupivacaine are seen on cardiac sodium and potassium channels, on isolated animal hearts and in whole animals, anaesthetised or awake. In particular the intravascular dose of levobupivacaine required to cause lethality in animals is consistently higher compared with bupivacaine. In awake sheep, for example, almost 78% more levobupivacaine was required to cause death. In contrast, in anaesthetised dogs no differences were seen in the incidence of spontaneous or electrical stimulation- induced ventricular tachycardia and fibrillations among animals exposed to levobupivacaine or bupivacaine. The reversibility of levobupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity has also been assessed. Some data point to an advantage of levobupivacaine over bupivacaine but this potential advantage was not confirmed in a recent study in anaesthetised dogs. Three clinical studies have been conducted using surrogate markers of both cardiac and CNS toxicity. In these studies levobupivacaine or bupivacaine were given by intravascular injection to healthy volunteers. Levobupivacaine was found to cause smaller changes in indices of cardiac contractility and the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and also to have less depressant effect on the electroencephalogram. Assuming that levobupivacaine has the same local anaesthetic potency as bupivacaine, then, all things being equal, it is difficult to argue that levobupivacaine should not displace bupivacaine as the long-acting local anaesthetic of choice. It would appear, however, that levobupivacaine has not yet significantly displaced bupivacaine from the markets in which it is sold. This may be due to a lack of perceived safety benefit and/or consideration of the additional costs that are associated with switching to levobupivacaine, which is approximately 57% more expensive than bupivacaine. If the price of levobupivacaine were closer to bupivacaine then the argument to switch to levobupivacaine would undoubtedly be much stronger. With the continued clinical use of levobupivacaine the database available to make comparisons will increase and this may allow cost-benefit arguments to be made more forcefully for levobupivacaine in the future."
False,elucidate role dna repair phenomenon examined capacity murine baf lymphoid cells telabltransformed counterparts repair dna lesions caused gamma uvradiations anti cancer drug idarubicin nan,14987801,idarubicin,cancer,"Chromosomal translocations of tyrosine kinase c-ABL gene from chromosome 9 may generate oncogenic kinases exhibiting constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Recently, we have shown that ABL-fusion oncogenic tyrosine kinases, BCR/ABL and TEL/ABL, specific to hematopoietic malignances, induced resistance to DNA-damaging agents. To elucidate the role of DNA repair in this phenomenon we examined the capacity of murine BaF3 lymphoid cells and their TEL/ABL-transformed counterparts to repair DNA lesions caused by gamma- and UV-radiations and the anti-cancer drug, idarubicin. TEL/ABL-transformed cells displayed resistance to these DNA damaging agents as evaluated by MTT assay and the survival advantage was associated with an accelerated kinetics of DNA repair as measured by the alkaline comet assay. Deoxyribonucleosides (dNTPs) supplementation of the repair medium further stimulated DNA repair and the effect was specific to the DNA damage agent used in the experiment but only the transformed cells displayed this feature. A variety of damages induced imply the multi-pathway of DNA repair involved. We also examined the capability of BCR/ABL-fusion to modulate the repair of oxidative lesions, considered as a major side effect of various anti-cancer drugs including idarubicin and radiation. Employing the free radical scavenger alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN, a spin trap) and DNA repair enzymes: endonuclease III (EndoIII) that nicks DNA at sites of oxidized bases, we found that BCR/ABL-transformed cells repaired oxidative DNA lesions more effectively than control cells. Our results suggest, that oncogenic ABL-dependent stimulation of DNA repair may contribute to the cell resistance to genotoxic treatment."

True,primary aim study clarify efficacy opioid rotation morphine fentanyl symptom palliation morphine induced delirium nan,16043013,morphine,delirium,"Although recent studies suggest that opioid rotation could be an effective treatment strategy for morphine-induced delirium, there have been no prospective studies to investigate the treatment effects of opioid rotation using fentanyl. The primary aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in symptom palliation of morphine-induced delirium. Twenty-one consecutive cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium underwent opioid rotation to fentanyl. Physicians recorded the symptom severity of delirium (the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, MDAS), pain, and other symptoms (categorical verbal scale from 0: none to 3: severe) and the Schedule for Team Assessment Scale (STAS) (from 0: none to 4: extreme); and performance status at the time of study enrollment and three and seven days after. Of 21 patients recruited, one patient did not complete the study. In the remaining 20 patients, morphine was substituted with transdermal fentanyl in 9 patients and parenteral fentanyl in 11 patients. Total opioid dose increased from 64 mg oral morphine equivalent/day (Day 0) to 98 mg/day (Day 7), and the median increase in total opioid dose was 42%. Treatment success, defined as an MDAS score below 10 and pain score of 2 or less, was obtained in 13 patients on Day 3 and 18 patients on Day 7. The mean MDAS score significantly decreased from 14 (Day 0) to 6.4 and 3.6 (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Pain scores significantly decreased from 2.2 (Day 0) to 1.3 and 1.1 on the categorical verbal scale (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001); from 2.6 (Day 0) to 1.6 and 1.3 on the STAS (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Symptom scores of dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting significantly decreased, and performance status significantly improved. Opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl may be effective in alleviating delirium and pain in cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium."

A potential severe side-effect, known as dapsone-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS), may occur. DHS is characterized by fever, skin rashes, lymphadenopathy and multiorgan dysfunction manifesting as hepatitis, cholangitis, pneumonitis, colitis, thyroiditis and myocarditis. However, DHS-associated complete atrioventricular block has not previously been reported. We describe here a 45-year-old Chinese woman who developed DHS after 5 weeks of dapsone therapy for pustular palmoplantar psoriasis. In addition to typical DHS symptoms, she experienced several episodes of syncope as a result of complete atrioventricular block which was successfully reversed with a permanent pacemaker implantation."

Focal injury in the cortex was produced by infusion of lactate at acid pH or by stab caused by needle insertion. Infarcts in substantia nigra pars reticulata were evoked by prolonged pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. Immunohistochemical staining for NFs showed characteristic terminal clubs of axons in the borderzone of lesions. Differences in the labelling pattern occurred with different antibodies which apparently depended on molecular weight class of NFs and phosphorylation state. These immunohistochemical changes of NFs can serve as a marker for axonal damage in various experimental traumatic or ischemic lesions."

Studies in rats have revealed a sex difference in the response to a vasopressin infusion, which was diminished after treatment with an NSAID. This study was performed in man to investigate the influence of sex and concomitant treatment of piroxicam on the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of desmopressin, and to validate a previously described indirect response model. Eight healthy males and eight healthy females participated in the trial, which was conducted in a pharmacokinetic (PK) part followed by a pharmacodynamic (PD) part. Desmopressin was administered intravenously as a single dose (PK = dose 2 microg, PD = dose 0.2 microg). Piroxicam was administered to achieve steady state. The pharmacokinetic parameters of desmopressin were estimated and calculated by means of two-compartmental analysis. In the dynamic part a study design based on an oral hydration model was used. Parameters for urine flow and urine osmolality were estimated. Individual estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters served as input to the indirect response model that subsequently was fitted to urine osmolality data. The pharmacokinetics of desmopressin after a fixed bolus injection was neither influenced by piroxicam nor sex of the subject. The pharmacodynamics of desmopressin showed a sex difference where females exhibited a more pronounced antidiuretic effect than males, which was statistically significant when the effects were submaximal (>4.5 h after dose). The sex differences were diminished after pre-treatment with piroxicam, indicating a prostaglandin PGE(2)-mediated mechanism. The indirect response model was confirmed, although the modelling could not distinguish a sex difference, indicating a limitation of this model compared with traditional descriptive statistics."

Preclinical data indicate cisplatin sensitivity, suggesting that these tumors may have defects in the BRCA1 pathway. The carboplatin and gemcitabine (CG) combination is active in unselected anthracycline/taxane pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients, so we carried out a phase II study to evaluate the activity of the CG combination in pretreated metastatic TNBC patients. From 10/2004 to 3/2009 we enrolled 31 patients. Median age was 57 years and 29 patients out of 31 had visceral involvement. The overall response rate (ORR) was 32% (1 complete response /9 partial responses), in addition 5 patients obtained stable disease for >12 weeks. After a median follow-up of 34 months, all patients progressed with a median time to progression of 5.5 months and median overall survival of 11 months. Dose reductions, delays and omissions occurred in 75 (60%), 36 (29%) and 22 (18%) cycles. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 17 and febrile neutropenia in 4 patients. Ten patients had Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. Non hematological toxicities were manageable. The CG combination is a reasonable option for the treatment of metastatic pretreated TNBC patients."

True,hand mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsions evoked carbachol eserine significantly changed calcium chloridenan,6892185,eserine,tremor,"The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."
False,pentoxifylline downregulates nitric oxide tumor necrosis factoralpha induced mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan macrophage cell linenan,11875767,nitric oxide,necrosis,"Pentoxifylline (PTX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is known to downregulate tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion induced by lipopolysacchride (LPS) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). We have had limited success in treating leprosy reactions, including erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), in which TNF-alpha has been identified as a major proinflammatory cytokine. PTX inhibited production of NO (IC50 approximately equal to 1.0 mg/ml) and TNF-alpha (IC50 approximately equal to 0.05 mg/ml) in a dose-dependent fashion. As little as 0.5 mg/ml of PTX decreased NO production and 0.01 mg/ml of PTX inhibited TNF-alpha production. Western blot analyses demonstrated that iNOS was suppressed by PTX. Northern blot analyses showed significant reduction of TNF-alpha mRNA. We conclude that PTX is an effective inhibitor of lipoarabinomannan (LAM)-induced TNF-alpha production at both the product and transcriptional levels in our macrophage cell line. PTX also showed moderate inhibition of NO at the product level as well as translation of iNOS."

We measured the degree of morphologic damage by ultrastructural examination of endomyocardial biopsy and the degree of performance abnormally by right heart catheterization in patients receiving DXR. Morphologic damage was variable but was proportional to the total cumulative DXR dose between 100 and 600 mg/m2. Performance abnormalities correlated weakly with dose, exhibited a curvilinear relationship, and had a ""threshold"" for expression. Catheterization abnormalities correlated well with morphologic damage (r = 0.57 to 0.78) in a subgroup of patients in whom exercise hemodynamics were measured, and this relationship also exhibited a curvilinear, threshold configuration. In DXR-CM myocardial damage is proportional to the degree of cytotoxic insult (DXR dose) while myocardial function is preserved until a critical dose or degree of damage is reached, after which myocardial performance deteriorates rapidly."
False,results suggest intravenous penicillin remains excellent choice therapy cases peritonsillar abscess requiring parenteral antibiotics drainagenan,9914550,penicillin,peritonsillar abscess,"Despite the fact that peritonsillar abscess is the most common complication of acute tonsillitis, the treatment of peritonsillar abscess remains controversial. One element of controversy is the choice of antibiotics after drainage of the abscess. In an attempt to assess the effect of antibiotic choice on the treatment of peritonsillar abscess, we conducted a retrospective review of records from patients with peritonsillar abscess treated with incision and drainage. Our review identified 103 patients, comprising two groups: 58 patients treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and 45 patients treated with intravenous penicillin alone. These patients were hospitalized after incision and drainage, and therefore their clinical courses and responses to therapy could be rigorously assessed. Characterization of illness based on patient age, temperature, and white blood cell count revealed similar severity of illness between the two groups. Comparison of clinical outcomes with respect to hours hospitalized (mean 44.3 +/- 6.6 and 38.3 +/- 7.1 hours, 95% confidence interval, for broad-spectrum and penicillin groups, respectively) and mean hours febrile (16.9 +/- 5.0 and 13.3 +/- 4.2 hours, 95% confidence interval) were not statistically significantly different (p = 0.222 and 0.269, respectively) between groups, indicating that broad-spectrum antibiotics failed to show greater efficacy than penicillin in the treatment of these patients. The microbiologic characteristics of these infections, failures of therapy, and complication rates were similar to those reported in the literature. These results suggest that intravenous penicillin remains an excellent choice for therapy in cases of peritonsillar abscess requiring parenteral antibiotics after drainage."
False,two cases delapril group withdrawn study intolerable cough one case manidipine group intolerable dizziness headachenan,11336083,delapril,dizziness,"This study was designed to investigate the effect of delapril, an ACE inhibitor, and manidipine, a long action calcium antagonist, on persistent microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients. Sixty type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to take delapril 30 mg/day or manidipine 10 mg/day for 48 weeks, in an open label design. Twenty eight of thirty subjects in the delapril group and twenty nine of thirty in the manidipine group completed the study. Urine albumin excretion as measured by the urinary albumin creatinine ratio decreased significantly in both groups (112.0+/-60.9 to 95.3+/-64.9 mg/g and 108.5+/-51.0 to 96.4+/-53.5 mg/g in the delapril and manidipine group respectively, p < 0.05, by paired t-test). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly changed after treatment in the delapril group but significantly decreased in the manidipine group (130.9+/-7.1/80.2+/-6.1 to 127.2+/-7.1/78.0+/-5.3 mm/Hg, p < 0.05, by student's paired t-test). After 48 weeks of treatment, two patients in the delapril group and one patient in the manidipine group converted to normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) and one patient in each group progressed to overt nephropathy (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g). There were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, serum fructosamine, creatinine, potassium and lipid profiles after 48 weeks of treatment in both groups. Two cases in the delapril group were withdrawn during the study because of an intolerable cough and one case in the manidipine group because of intolerable dizziness and headache. In conclusion, both delapril and manidipine are effective in the reduction of microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria."

Forty-eight children with kidney insufficiency were divided into four groups: Group 1--diet according to Bergström with EAA and cetoanalogue supplementation plus UV therapy; Group 2--diet plus EAA and cetoanalogue supplementation without UV therapy; Group 3--without diet and supplementation of EAA and ceto but with UV therapy; Group 4--without any diet and without UV therapy. The average levels of kidney insufficiency in all children at the stage of a manifest kidney insufficiency were not significantly different. As a result it became obvious that children exposed to UV irradiation with or without a diet had better post-treatment values and that children with kidney insufficiency reacted to UV therapy plus diet best of all. One can obtain the same results also by oral vitamin D therapy, although we have to point out the danger of calcinosis and stone formation which the author could frequently demonstrate, but never after UV treatment."

Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were randomized to receive either ketoprofen, 100 mg, three times a day (ketoprofen group, n = 9) or a weak NSAID, acetaminophen, 1 g, three times a day (acetaminophen group, n = 9) starting immediately after the diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH. Treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively. Test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first, third, and fifth postoperative mornings. Maximal platelet aggregation induced by 6 microM of adenosine diphosphate decreased after administration of ketoprofen. Aggregation was lower (P < .05) in the ketoprofen group than in the acetaminophen group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day. In contrast, maximal platelet aggregation increased in the acetaminophen group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment platelet aggregation results (P < .05). One patient in the ketoprofen group developed a postoperative intracranial hematoma. Coagulation (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [APPT], fibrinogen concentration, and antithrombin III [AT III]) was comparable between the two groups. Ketoprofen but not acetaminophen impaired platelet function in patients with SAH. If ketoprofen is used before surgery on cerebral artery aneurysms, it may pose an additional risk factor for hemorrhage."
True,pinealectomized chick pretreatment dopamine increased duration catatonia doc ketamine pretreatment norepinephrinedopamine made duration catatonia longer means dopamine made catatonia worse,6540303,dopamine,catatonia,"The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal idolamines on ketamine-induced catatonia in the intact, pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat. In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of catatonia (DOC) after ketamine, but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not. The pineal indolamines exhibited mixed actions. Serotonin and N-acetyl serotonin which augmented ketamine DOC, did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland, whereas melatonin potentiated the ketamine DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick. Ketamine was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent; furthermore, melatonin did not augment the ketamine DOC whereas dopamine continued to do so. This study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the amines on the pineal in spite of the immature blood-brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat. In addition, these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketamine DOC induced by melatonin. Furthermore, dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine catatonia rather than directly on the pituitary."

Paracetamol, the most commonly used oral analgesic for paediatric patients, was compared with a new palatable syrup formulation of diclofenac. Sixty-three ASA 1 orA SA 2 children aged one year and above were randomly assigned to receive diclofenac (Group A) or paracetamol (Group B). The study drug was given 30 to 60 minutes before induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with either inhalational sevoflurane or intravenous thiopentone. All subjects received intravenous fentanyl 1 microg/kg(-1) intraoperatively. Postoperative pain was assessed by a blinded observer using the CHEOPS score on eye-opening, and then at 10, 30 and 60 minutes. Children with a CHEOPS score > 7 received further fentanyl 1 microg x kg(-1). The number of cases requiring this ""rescue"" analgesia was recorded. Both groups were comparable in demographics, induction technique, duration of anaesthesia and time between premedication and induction of anaesthesia. Overall, CHEOPS scores were low for both groups at all times and did not differ between the groups at any time. Twenty per cent of the diclofenac group and 27% of the paracetamol group required rescue analgesia (not statistically significant). The efficacy of diclofenac 0.5 mg x kg(-1) and paracetamol 15 mg x kg(-1) as oral analgesic premedication for BMT was comparable in children receiving an anaesthetic which included intraoperative administration of fentanyl 1 microg x kg(-1)."

Arterial wall shear rate (ultrasound technique, profilmeter FRP III), the systo-diastolic diameter (echotracking technique) and the mean blood flow velocity and volume of the common carotid artery, the blood viscosity (rotational viscometer) and the finger arterial blood pressure (Finapress Ohmeda) were measured in 12 young volunteers (aged 25+/-2 years) and in 12 elderly hypertensives (aged 80+/-4 years) treated with short-acting calcium antagonists up to 24h before the study, both at baseline and after intravenous furosemide infusion (0.5mg/min), when the haematocrit had increased by at least two percentage points. After furosemide administration the mean arterial blood pressure decreased and blood viscosity and carotid systolic shear stress increased in both groups. However, common carotid artery diameter increased only in the young controls but not in the elderly hypertensives. These data show that an increase in carotid shear stress caused by haemoconcentration induces carotid vasodilatation only in young healthy subjects, and not in elderly hypertensives. This effect may be related to impaired endothelium function and/or arterial wall mechanics."

A total of 16,917 patients with hypertension were evaluated at 2214 primary and community care facilities; 7808 of these patients had not been treated previously for hypertension; 3928 were switched to terazosin from another antihypertensive agent; and 5181 received terazosin in addition to an agent that had not controlled their hypertension. Terazosin produced highly significant reductions in systolic (-18.2 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) and diastolic (-13.2 +/- 0.1 mm Hg) BP when used as monotherapy (mean dose, 3.1 mg; range, 2 to 10 mg) without causing a significant increase in heart rate. Equal antihypertensive efficacy was demonstrated in men, women, blacks, and whites of all ages, with particular benefit to elderly patients (> or = 65 years of age) with systolic hypertension. Comparative studies indicated that terazosin had equal antihypertensive efficacy in combination with diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Patients who had not responded to monotherapy with one of these classes of antihypertensive drugs showed significant reductions of BP after terazosin, in the following average doses, was added to diuretics, 3.1 mg; beta-blockers, 3.4 mg; calcium channel blockers, 3.3 mg; and ACE inhibitors, 3.4 mg. Terazosin produced highly significant reductions in blood levels of total cholesterol (-5.0%), triglycerides (-6.1%), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-7.6%) without change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy. Similar favorable effects on blood lipid levels were demonstrated when terazosin was used in combination with all other classes of antihypertensive drugs. The greatest reductions in blood cholesterol (-9.2%) were observed among patients with hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol > or = 240 mg/dL). Terazosin maintained its antihypertensive efficacy and was well tolerated by patients with a variety of concomitant diseases, including congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes, and obesity. Adverse effects occurred in 17.9% of patients and caused 2.2% to drop out of the study. The most frequent adverse effects were dizziness (4.8%), headache (2.5%), and asthenia (2.4%). Only 0.4% suffered syncope and 0.2% impotence. These data demonstrate the usefulness of terazosin as monotherapy or add-on therapy for treatment of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

True,alzheimers disease ad associated deficiency acetylcholine ach forebrain correlates brain pathology cognitive dysfunctionnan,10332937,ACh/acetylcholine,AD/Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a deficiency of acetylcholine (ACh) in the forebrain that correlates with brain pathology and cognitive dysfunction. The most promising approach to enhancing central ACh neurotransmission has been the utilization of agents that inhibit cholinesterases which block its catabolism. Initially, the success of this strategy was limited by subtherapeutic levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, tolerability problems and toxicity of the first agents. Donepezil HCI represents a new chemical class of AChE inhibitors, the piperidines. In clinical trials, donepezil has been shown to improve significantly cognition and global function in patients with mild to moderately severe AD, and has demonstrated an excellent tolerability and safety profile. These benefits, as well as a simple, once-daily dosing regimen, make donepezil a viable therapeutic option for AD patients."
False,bps standard treatment cancer hypercalcemia dose mg pamidronate mg clodronate recommended former compound potent longer lasting effectnan,12136223,pamidronate,cancer hypercalcemia,"Bisphosphonates (BPs) are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and it is well accepted that tumor cells in bone, especially breast cancer and myeloma cells, can stimulate osteoclast formation and activity leading to the release of growth factors or cytokines, which will further stimulate cancer cells' growth and their secretion of osteolytic factors. BPs are now the standard treatment for cancer hypercalcemia, for which a dose of 90 mg of pamidronate or 1500 mg of clodronate is recommended; the former compound is more potent and has a longer lasting effect. Repeated pamidronate infusions exert clinically relevant analgesic effects in more than half of patients with metastatic bone pain. Recent data suggest that non-responding patients should perhaps be treated with higher doses. The optimal dose actually remains to be defined, especially as it is thought that it is probably a function of the disease stage. Regular pamidronate infusions can also achieve a partial objective response according to conventional UICC criteria and they can almost double the objective response rate to chemotherapy. Lifelong administration of oral clodronate to patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone reduces the frequency of morbid skeletal events by more than one-fourth. Two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials comparing monthly 90 mg pamidronate infusions to placebo infusions for 1-2 years in addition to hormone or chemotherapy in patients with at least one lytic bone metastasis have shown that the mean skeletal morbidity rate could be reduced by 30-40%. The results obtained with intravenous BPs are generally viewed as better than those obtained with oral clodronate. However, preference can be given to the oral route when BPs are started early in the process of metastatic bone disease in a patient receiving hormone therapy. According to the recently published ASCO guidelines, pamidronate 90 mg i.v. delivered over 2 h every 3-4 weeks can be recommended in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have imaging evidence of lytic destruction of bone and who are concurrently receiving systemic therapy with hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Furthermore, the ASCO Panel considered it ""reasonable"" to start i.v. BPs in women with localized pain whose bone scans were abnormal and plain radiographs normal, but not when an abnormal bone scan is asymptomatic. The pertinence of these criteria is discussed below. Because BPs are providing supportive care, reducing the rate of skeletal morbidity but evidently not abolishing it, the criteria for stopping their administration have to be different from those used for classic antineoplastic drugs, and they should not be stopped when metastatic bone disease is progressing. However, criteria to determine whether and for how long an individual patient benefits from their administration are lacking. New biochemical markers of bone resorption might help identify those patients continuing to benefit from therapy. Even better results have been achieved in patients with multiple myeloma, and the general consensus is that BPs should be started as soon as the diagnosis of lytic disease is made in myeloma patients. On the other hand, data are scanty in prostate cancer, but large-scale trials with potent BPs are ongoing or planned in such patients. Similar results to those achieved with pamidronate have been obtained with monthly 6-mg infusions of the newer BP ibandronate in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone. The tolerance of ibandronate could be better, and the drug has the potential to be administered as a 15- to 30-min infusion. Zoledronate can also be administered safely as a 15-min 4-mg infusion, and large scale phase III trials have just been completed. These newer BPs will simplify the current therapeutic schemes and improve the cost-effectiveness ratio; they also have the potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy, at least in patients with an aggressive osteolytic disease or when given as adjuvant therapy. For that matter, initial data with clodronate indicate that they have the potential to prevent the development of bone metastases, but the use of BPs in the adjuvant setting must still be viewed as experimental."

DHS is characterized by fever, skin rashes, lymphadenopathy and multiorgan dysfunction manifesting as hepatitis, cholangitis, pneumonitis, colitis, thyroiditis and myocarditis. However, DHS-associated complete atrioventricular block has not previously been reported. We describe here a 45-year-old Chinese woman who developed DHS after 5 weeks of dapsone therapy for pustular palmoplantar psoriasis. In addition to typical DHS symptoms, she experienced several episodes of syncope as a result of complete atrioventricular block which was successfully reversed with a permanent pacemaker implantation."
True,promoter activation following induction pwaf gene flavone involved phase arrest lung adenocarcinoma cellsnan,9804172,flavone,A549 lung adenocarcinoma,"Flavonoids are present in many plants including edible fruits and vegetables. Recently, many of the biological activities of flavonoids have been elucidated. Flavone is a well known flavonoid, and many of its derivatives have been shown to have anti-proliferative effects on several cancer cells. We report here that flavone can effectively inhibit the cell growth of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and 100 microM flavone causes cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. As a mechanism underlying the cell cycle arrest, flavone markedly increases the mRNA and protein levels of a universal inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, p21/WAF1, and inhibits phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (RB) protein. Although A549 cells possess wild-type p53, flavone does not induce the p53 protein, suggesting that p21/WAF1 induction is p53-independent. In addition, 100 microM flavone significantly increases the promoter activity of the p21/WAF1 gene by 5-fold. These results suggest that the G1 phase arrest by flavone is due to p53-independent transcriptional induction of the p21/WAF1 gene and the subsequent dephosphorylation of RB protein."
True,find clinically achievable levels 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine azadc potent inhibitor dna methylation modify chromatin restore ability tumor necrosis factor alpha tnfalpha induce monocytic differentiation acute myeloid leukemia cells nbnan,19117987,5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine,necrosis,"Transcriptional silencing via promoter methylation of genes important for cell growth and differentiation plays a key role in myeloid leukemogenesis. We find that clinically achievable levels of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC), a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation, can modify chromatin and restore the ability of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) to induce monocytic differentiation of the acute myeloid leukemia cells NB4 and U937. Although 5-AZA-dC cannot fully induce differentiation, we show that 5-AZA-dC acts directly on TNFalpha-responsive promoters to facilitate TNFalpha-induced transcriptional pathways leading to differentiation. 5-AZA-dC regulates the expression of Dif-2, a TNFalpha target gene, by deacetylating chromatin domains in a methylation-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of the Dif-2 promoter show histone hyperacetylation and a recruitment of the nuclear factor-kappaB transcription factor in response to 5-AZA-dC. Furthermore, 5-AZA-dC plus TNFalpha enhances the level of phosphorylated RNA Pol II at the Dif-2 promoter via synergistic recruitment of TFIIH. We conclude that nonspecific changes in chromatin can allow a specific transcriptional inducer to overcome blocks in leukemic cell differentiation. Our results support the concept of low doses of 5-AZA-dC acting in combination with other agents to target epigenetic changes that drive malignant growth in leukemic cells.

True,although pcp classified human carcinogen epidemiological observations suggest exposure chlorophenols general pcp solutions particular may result increased risk certain malignant disorders nasal carcinoma soft tissue sarcomanan,7904464,chlorophenols,nasal carcinoma,"Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was, and still is, one of the most frequently used fungicides and pesticides. Its toxicity is due to interference with oxidative phosphorylation. Acute and chronic poisoning may occur by dermal absorption, inhalation or ingestion. Chronic poisoning occurs mainly in sawmill workers or people living in log homes treated with PCP-containing wood protecting formulations. Quantitative determination of PCP in urine and serum is useful to detect occupational or subclinical exposure. The clinical features of acute and chronic PCP poisoning can be classified systematically into effects on the skin, metabolism (fever), the haematopoietic tissue, the respiratory system, the central and peripheral nervous system, the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract. Although PCP is not classified as a human carcinogen, some epidemiological observations suggest that exposure to chlorophenols in general and PCP solutions in particular may result in an increased risk for certain malignant disorders such as nasal carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma. There is concern that contamination of PCP-solutions with products such as chlorodibenzo-p-dioxins is the real cause of this suspected carcinogenicity. No specific antidote exists for the treatment of (acute) PCP poisoning. The basis of the treatment of acute poisoning is intensive supportive care with prevention of dangerous rise in temperature. Use of PCP-based products as indoor wood preservatives poses an unacceptable risk to human health."

We present herein the first case of SCLE induced by acebutolol. A 57-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of a cutaneous eruption of the photo-exposed areas. One month ago, the patient had started a treatment with oral acebutolol to cure a hypertension of 1-year evolution. Physical examination revealed erythematous scaly annular plaques, involving the face, arms and trunk. Immunologic serology findings revealed a positive titer of antinuclear antibodies up to 1/1,280 with positivity of antihistone and Ro/SSA antibodies. Acebutolol was stopped, and the lesions cleared completely 4 months later. Literature data, along with our case, suggest a link between acebutolol therapy and the onset of a lupus syndrome. Although this is the first report of acebutolol-induced SCLE, we should be aware of this occurrence, and avoidance of acebutolol is recommended in patients with stigmata of lupus erythematosus."
True,based observations case report clinicians readily consider furosemide potential cause thrombocytopenia nan,23625769,furosemide,thrombocytopenia,"Immune thrombocytopenia has been attributed to many causes. Several drugs have been implicated as culprits in causing drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Although the mechanism for this type of thrombocytopenia is not well understood, at least three types of antibodies appear to be involved: drug-dependent antibodies, hapten-dependent antibodies, and drug-induced platelet-reactive autoantibodies. In this report, we describe a case in which furosemide was identified as the probable cause of drug-induced thrombocytopenia in an 84-year-old man with chronic symptomatic idiopathic thrombocytopenia for seven years before discovery. The patient's platelet count and daily furosemide dose, both intravenous and oral, were documented throughout his medical history. A dose-dependent change in platelet count was observed in association with the furosemide dose. His platelet count increased on discontinuation of furosemide and beginning of torsemide. Several months after discontinuation of furosemide, his platelet count increased to a 9-year high of 206 × 10³/mm³ from a low of 36 × 10³/mm³ while receiving furosemide therapy. Based on the observations of this case report, clinicians should more readily consider furosemide as a potential cause of thrombocytopenia."

They react easily with electrophiles in aprotic solvents to regenerate gossypolone or to form dehydrogossypoldithianes and dehydrogossypoldithiolanes, which display higher toxicity on KB cells. In addition, the low toxicity of gossypol thioderivatives was reversed by nitric oxide donors in physiological media. These experiments suggest that gossypol and gossypolone dithianes and dithiolanes can be used as prodrugs that target tumor cells surrounded by high concentrations of nitric oxide."

A significant dose-concentration effect relationship was found for the three naproxen doses (500, 1000 and 1500 mg daily). The following variables were measured: global clinical effect, joint index, morning stiffness, activity of daily living (ADL), pain during movement and at rest. The naproxen dose-concentration effect relationship curve was moved to the left by the addition of 4 g paracetamol daily. No major side effects were observed, but complaints concerning the gastrointestinal tract were fewer on lower naproxen doses and these were not increased by concomitant paracetamol treatment. The results show that the clinical effect of naproxen in RA may be significantly increased by concomitant paracetamol administration."

Using functional and binding assays, ERb-131 was characterized as a potent and selective estrogen receptor beta agonist. In vivo, ERb-131 was devoid of estrogen receptor alpha activity as assessed in a rat uterotrophic assay. ERb-131 alleviated tactile hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin, and reversed tactile allodynia caused by spinal nerve ligation and various chemical insults. Moreover, ERb-131 did not influence the pain threshold of normal healthy animals. Thus, estrogen receptor beta agonism is a critical effector in attenuating a broad range of anti-nociceptive states."
True, days pan treatment induced significant proteinuria hypoalbuminemia decreased urinary sodium excretion extensive ascitesnan,15075188,PAN,hypoalbuminemia,"Nephrotic syndrome is often accompanied by sodium retention and generalized edema. However, the molecular basis for the decreased renal sodium excretion remains undefined. We hypothesized that epithelial Na channel (ENaC) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased sodium retention. An experimental group of rats was treated with puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN; 180 mg/kg iv), whereas the control group received only vehicle. After 7 days, PAN treatment induced significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, decreased urinary sodium excretion, and extensive ascites. The protein abundance of alpha-ENaC and beta-ENaC was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (ISOM) and in the inner medulla (IM) but was not altered in the cortex. gamma-ENaC abundance was increased in the cortex, ISOM, and IM. Immunoperoxidase brightfield- and laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha-ENaC, beta-ENaC, and gamma-ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), connecting tubule, and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments. Immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha-ENaC in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of PAN-treated rats, indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha-ENaC subunits. In contrast, the protein abundances of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 3 (NHE3), Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (BSC-1), and thiazide-sensitive Na(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (TSC) were decreased. Moreover, the abundance of the alpha(1)-subunit of the Na-K-ATPase was decreased in the cortex and ISOM, but it remained unchanged in the IM. In conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with PAN-induced nephrotic syndrome. The decreased abundance of NHE3, BSC-1, TSC, and Na-K-ATPase may play a compensatory role to promote sodium excretion."
False,accumulating evidence demonstrated epcs therapeutic potential reactive oxygen species rosmediated vascular diseases nan,23778534,oxygen,vascular diseases,"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) repair vascular damage and participate in neovascularization. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that EPCs have therapeutic potential in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated vascular diseases. In this study, to investigate the effects of oxidative stress on EPCs, EPCs were treated with H2O2 at different final concentrations for 3 h. MTT assay, scratch-wound assay and Matrigel invasion assay revealed that cell proliferation, migration and tubule formation and function, respectively, were impaired under H2O2 stress in a concentration-dependent manner. To determine protein response to H2O2 stress, two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry were performed. The results revealed that triosephosphate isomerase and ADP-sugar pyrophosphatase were downregulated, while peroxiredoxin-2, thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase, mitochondrial (Prx‑3), peroxiredoxin-6, EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, vimentin and Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor α were upregulated in the H2O2-treated EPCs. To further confirm the results from mass spectrometry, the expression pattern of Prx-3 in response to H2O2 stress was examined by western blot analysis. The data presented in this study provide novel insight into the defensive mechanisms of EPCs and the pathways of oxidative damage in an oxidative environment."

True,motion stimulation increased nicotine induced dizziness nausea significantly influence nin postural imbalancenan,17990061,nicotine,dizziness,"Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."

True,although clear causality ginkgo intake bleeding could established observations generally explained plateletactivating factor pafantagonistic action ginkgolides represent characteristic constituents ginkgo extractsnan,15693702,ginkgolides,bleeding,"The special Ginkgo biloba leaf extract EGb 761 is marketed for more then two decades. During this time its therapeutic efficacy and favorable safety profile have been proven in numerous clinical trails as well as by postmarketing surveillance in accordance with German drug regulations. During recent years, however, several cases of hemorrhage have been reported to occur in coincidence with the use of Ginkgo products. Although a clear causality between Ginkgo intake and bleeding could not be established, these observations have generally been explained by the platelet-activating factor (PAF)-antagonistic action of ginkgolides, which represent characteristic constituents of Ginkgo extracts. PAF was originally characterized by inducing aggregation and secretion of serotonin and histamine from rabbit platelets. We now confirmed that induction of aggregation of human platelets by PAF requires at least 200 times higher concentration when compared to rabbit cells. Under the chosen experimental conditions, PAF-mediated aggregation of human platelets was half-maximally inhibited by ginkgolide B, A, C and J at concentrations of 2.5, 15.8, 29.8 and 43.5 microg/ml, respectively. These concentrations are generally more than 100 times higher as the peak plasma values measured after oral intake of EGb 761 at recommended doses between 120 and 240 mg. As PAF is a 'weak' platelet activator, which does not appear to be of importance for primary hemostasis, our results rise serious doubts that the PAF antagonistic effect of ginkgolides could be responsible for hemorrhage in patients taking EGb 761."

In this prospective, multicenter, non-comparative, open-label study, patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (n = 111) received pregabalin in doses ranging from 75 to 300 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. Primary efficacy measures included weekly pain score and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Despite a short study duration, a significant reduction was seen in weekly pain score (p < 0.0001), as well as VAS score of SF-MPQ (p < 0.0001). Significant improvements were also seen in other pain-related endpoints, weekly sleep interference score, quality of life measures, and patient and clinician ratings of global improvement. Pregabalin was well tolerated, and the most common adverse events were dizziness and somnolence. The short study duration precluded the assessment of longer term safety issues such as weight gain. This study has demonstrated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of pregabalin for peripheral neuropathic pain in Indian patients."

In this article, we discuss the ocular toxicity in six patients with advanced nonpretreated colorectal cancer who received megadoses of carmustine and mitomycin with the support of autologous bone marrow transplantation. The results obtained did not reveal any subjective or objective pathologic conditions of the ocular apparatus with particular attention to orthoptic examinations, the anterior segment, and the fundus. No patient had changes in visual acuity. Tonometry did not demonstrate significant variations. There were, however, qualitative and quantitative changes in the tear films of all patients, leading to damage to the corneal and conjunctival epithelium."

False,inhibition intrahepatic metastasis human hepatocellular carcinoma rhoassociated protein kinase inhibitor y-27632 nan,11230737,Y-27632,hepatocellular carcinoma,"Intrahepatic metastasis is one of the most important prognostic factors for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cell motility mediated by Rho- and p160 Rho-associated coiledcoil forming protein kinase (p160ROCK) signaling pathways has recently been shown to play a critical role in intrahepatic metastasis in human HCC. Furthermore, the stable introduction of dominant-negative p160ROCK into Li7 cells resulted in a reduced metastatic rate in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). To investigate whether the specific p160ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, could also inhibit intrahepatic metastasis, the effect of Y-27632 on the cell motility and intrahepatic metastasis of Li7 was investigated. Y-27632 markedly blocked actin reorganization and motility of Li7 cells mediated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Y-27632 was administered continuously into the peritoneal cavity using a micro-osmotic pump, together with orthotopic implantation of Li7 cells into the liver of SCID mice. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone was administered as the control. The incidence of mice with metastatic nodules decreased in the Y-27632-treated group. The primary tumor volume at the site of injection was smaller in the Y-27632-treated group compared with the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Histologically, control tumors showed infiltrative growth into the sinusoidal area at the tumor boundary, whereas Y-27632-treated tumors showed expansive growth and low invasiveness. These findings confirm the importance of the Rho/p160ROCK signaling pathway in intrahepatic metastasis of human HCC, and indicate that Y-27632 may be useful for the prevention of intrahepatic metastasis of human HCC."

False,however administration dopamine postsynaptic antagonists expected increase synaptic dopamine availability thereby increasing hva concentrations according traditional models drug action nan,8341767,dopamine,drug action,"Homovanillic acid (HVA), an oxidative metabolite of dopamine, has been shown in a number of studies to reflect severity of symptoms and to predict response to neuroleptic treatment in schizophrenic patients. In several clinical studies, HVA levels have been shown to have a positive relationship with symptom severity and to decline over time upon treatment with antipsychotic agents. The magnitude of this decline appears to be related to the degree of symptom reduction in patients so treated. However, administration of dopamine postsynaptic antagonists should be expected to increase synaptic dopamine availability, thereby increasing HVA concentrations, according to traditional models of drug action. While in some studies, this appears to be the case, we saw no evidence of an early phase of HVA elevation after administration of 4- and 10-milligram doses of haloperidol to human volunteers. Rather, HVA levels declined during the period of absorption and attainment of peak haloperidol levels. Baseline HVA levels of 51.6 +/- 3.83 pmoles/ml and 56.8 +/- 5.70 pmoles/ml (after 4 mg and 10 mg., respectively) declined to minima of 35.6 +/- 1.67 pmoles/ml and 26.3 +/- 5.34 pmoles/ml respectively, at 3-4 hours after haloperidol administration. A trend was noted for the 10-mg dose to produce a greater decline than the 4-mg dose, which was most apparent at 4 hours after drug administration. The shape of both curves did not appear to be substantially different than expected on the basis of diurnal variation. These preliminary findings support the concept that dopamine turnover in humans is not increased and may be decreased by short-term administration of conventional neuroleptics."
True,one patients developed cardiac failure mg mmc mg doxorubicin nan,3137399,doxorubicin,cardiac failure,"Since 1975 mitomycin C (MMC) has been suggested to be cardiotoxic, especially when combined with or given following doxorubicin. Data on dose dependency or incidence concerning this side effect were not known. We have initiated a prospective study to obtain some more data on these subjects. Forty-four MMC-treated patients were studied, 37 of them could be evaluated. All patients were studied by repeated physical examinations, chest X-rays, electro- and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) determinations. The results were evaluated per cumulative dose level. One of the patients developed cardiac failure after 30 mg m-2 MMC and only 150 mg m-2 doxorubicin. The cardiac failure was predicted by a drop in EF determined during a cold pressor test. None of the other patients developed clinical cardiotoxicity, nor did the studied parameters change. The literature on this subject was also reviewed. Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature, we suggest that MMC-related cardiotoxicity is dose dependent, occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m-2 or more, mainly in patients also (previously or simultaneously) treated with doxorubicin. The incidence is likely to be less than 10% even for this risk group."

Among these drugs, ruthenium compounds have been showing promising results to treat tumors and represent an important development of new antitumor therapy. This study presents the evaluation of cis-(dichloro)tetraammineruthenium(III) chloride, cis-[RuCl(2)(NH(3))(4)]Cl, genotoxic effects using human peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in vitro. Mitotic index (MI), chromosome aberrations (CA), and DNA damage using the comet assay were analyzed. MI in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures treated with 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 microg mL(-1) cis-[RuCl(2)(NH(3))(4)]Cl were 5.9%, 4.6%, 3.9%, and 0%, respectively. Doxorubicin chloridate was used as the positive control. CA derived from 1, 10, and 100 microg mL(-1) concentrations were defined as spontaneous when compared with the negative control, and at the concentration of 1,000 microg mL(-1), the cell cycle was inhibited (IM = 0%). Results obtained for the comet assay using cis-[RuCl(2)(NH(3))(4)]Cl suggest that this compound has no genotoxic activity against cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes."

The camptothecin derivative irinotecan (CPT-11) has been shown to possess antitumor activity in phase II trials for patients with carcinoma of the lung, cervix, ovary, colon, or rectum and for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The current study was designed to test the efficacy of the drug against a panel of human tumor xenografts derived from adult and pediatric central nervous system malignancies. Tumors included childhood high-grade gliomas (D-212 MG, D-456 MG), adult high-grade gliomas (D-54 MG, D-245 MG), medulloblastomas (D341 Med, D487 Med), ependymomas (D528 EP, D612 EP), and a rhabdomyosarcoma (TE-671), as well as sublines with demonstrated resistance to busulfan (D-456 MG (BR)), cyclophosphamide (TE-671 CR), procarbazine (D-245 MG (PR)) or melphalan (TE-671 MR), growing subcutaneously and intracranially in athymic nude mice. In replicate experiments, CPT-11 was given at a dosage of 40 mg/kg per dose via intraperitoneal injection in 10% dimethylsulfoxide on days 1-5 and 8-12, which is the dosage lethal to 10% of treated animals. CPT-11 produced statistically significant (P < 0.001) growth delays in all subcutaneous xenografts tested, including those resistant to busulfan, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, and melphalan, with growth delays ranging from 21.3 days in D487 Med to 90+ days in several tumor lines. Further, tumor regression was evident in every treated animal bearing a subcutaneous tumor, with some xenografts yielding complete tumor regression. Statistically significant (P < 0.001) increases in survival were demonstrated in the two intracranial xenografts-D341 EP (73.0% increase) and D-456 MG (114.2% increase)-treated with CPT-11. These studies demonstrate that, of over 40 drugs evaluated in this laboratory, CPT-11 is the most active against central nervous system xenografts and should be advanced to clinical trial as soon as possible."
True,findings consistent increased incidence gallbladder disease related high progesterone states suggest mpa may causative agent cholelithiasisnan,1385654,progesterone,gallbladder disease,"Five out of forty-five adult men, 50 years of age or less, who had received, for at least six months, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, Depo Provera) IM, 200-400 mg/week, for prevention of sex-offending or genital-mutilating behavior developed symptomatic cholelithiasis. Thirty of these men were studied with gallbladder ultrasound prospectively off MPA and at six-month intervals while taking the medication and then six months off MPA. Gallstones recovered from two patients were found to have very high cholesterol content, suggesting they were formed in cholesterol supersaturated bile. These findings are consistent with the increased incidence of gallbladder disease related to high-progesterone states and suggest that MPA may be a causative agent in cholelithiasis. The physiologic studies on gallbladder contraction and cholecystokinin release in a subset of the patients failed to provide information on a mechanism for the possible increased incidence of gallbladder disease."
False,daidzein activates choline acetyltransferase mcixc cells improves druginduced amnesia nan,16428827,Daidzein,amnesia,"The choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activator, which enhances cholinergic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of acetylcholine (ACh), is an important factor in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect (46%) on ChAT in vitro. Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana, the active component was ultimately identified as daidzein (4',7-dihydroxy-isoflavone). In order to investigate the effects of daidzein from Pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine-induced impairments of learning and memory, we conducted a series of in vivo tests. Administration of daidzein (4.5 mg/kg body weight) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia, according to the results of a Y-maze test. Injections of scopolamine into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y-maze tests (a 37% decreases in alternation behavior). By way of contrast, mice treated with daidzein prior to the scopolamine injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment (an approximately 12%-21% decrease in alternation behavior). These results indicate that daidzein might play a role in acetylcholine biosynthesis as a ChAT activator, and that it also ameliorates scopolamine-induced amnesia."

Light microscopy study showed severe glomerulonephritis with crescent formation in 60% of the glomeruli and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the wall of an arteriole. Immunofluorescence revealed scanty granular IgG, IgA and C3 deposits along the capillary walls and mesangium. The patient was treated with steroid pulse, plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide and antiplatelet agents. A complete recovery of renal function was achieved in a few weeks. This new case of RPGN in the course of D-penicillamine treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and proteinuria in these patients. The prompt discontinuation of D-penicillamine and vigorous treatment measures could allow for a good prognosis as in this case."

This clinical picture resolved completely with cessation of the combined therapy. Baseline left ventricular function, assessed by cardiac catheterisation or nuclear angiography, was normal in two patients and only mildly reduced in the other. Simultaneously administration of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs and verapamil may result in profound adverse interactions and should only be administered with great caution."
False,estrogens involved breast cancer onset progression response steap 17beta-estradiol investigated mammary gland rats human breast cancer cell line mcfnan,18958632,17beta-estradiol,breast cancer,"Six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) was identified as a prostate-specific cell-surface antigen over-expressed in prostate cancer, and in human cancer cell lines obtained from several other tissues. Its cell surface location in all tumor types analyzed so far, and its absence in most vital organs in humans, turned STEAP1 into a potential target for anti-tumor immunotherapy. This study provides experimental evidence that STEAP1 is also over-expressed in human breast cancer cases, and in normal breast tissue adjacent to breast tumors, where it is localized in the cell membrane of epithelial cells. It is also demonstrated that STEAP1 transcription correlates negatively with estrogen receptor (ER) immunoreactivity, and positively with tumor grading in breast cancer cases. As estrogens are involved in breast cancer onset and progression, the response of STEAP1 to 17beta-estradiol (E2) was investigated in the mammary gland of rats, and in the human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. These experiments demonstrated that STEAP1 is down-regulated by E2 in both models. The mechanisms underlying the STEAP1 response to E2 in vitro were further investigated in MCF-7 cells, and the results obtained suggest an effect mediated by the membrane-bound ERalpha (mbERalpha)."

Acid protease (cathepsin D) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose, whereas activities were increased equally in patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to viral hepatitis whether or not they survived. A correlation was found between serum acid protease activity and prothrombin time, and the increase in cathepsin D activity was sustained over several days compared with aspartate aminotransferase, which showed a sharp early peak and then a fall. Circulating lysosomal proteases can damage other organs, and measurement of their activity may therefore be of added value in assessing prognosis in this condition."

Coronary angiography and left ventriculography were performed within an average of 8 days of exercise testing. Five patients had repeat exercise thallium-201 tomography after medical therapy or revascularization. All patients had large, reversible perfusion defects (average defect size 33.5 +/- 13%), with 11 of 12 patients having a > or = 25% stress perfusion defect. In 10 patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, the average stenosis of the involved vessel was 93 +/- 9% (range 70 to 100). The electrocardiographic leads with ST-segment elevation predicted the site of reversible hypoperfusion. Two patients had extensive, reversible anterior hypoperfusion due to exercise-induced spasm of minimally stenosed left anterior descending coronary arteries. Follow-up exercise testing in 5 patients showed abolition of reversible hypoperfusion and ST changes after medical therapy or revascularization. In patients without prior myocardial infarction, exercise-induced ST-segment elevation signifies extensive, reversible hypoperfusion that can be abolished by revascularization in patients with critical coronary stenoses and by medical therapy in those with coronary vasospasm."

A 71-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes underwent a laminectomy for an epidural abscess. On the 6th and 8th postoperative days, he underwent debridement for fasciitis in the both arms and iodoform gauze was applied to the wounds (both arms and lumbar region) at the end of the first debridement and then changed every day. His consciousness then gradually deteriorated after the debridement. His plasma iodine level was measured and was shown to be remarkably high (6,280 microg/dl) 19 days after the laminectomy (13 days after the beginning of iodoform application). His consciousness recovered gradually with a concomitant decrease in the plasma iodine level. Three months after the removal of the iodoform he became almost alert. Caution should be exercised in using iodoform gauze because of the possibility that it could affect consciousness."

False,aviptadil aerosol caused small temporary significant selective pulmonary vasodilation improved stroke volume mixed venous oxygen saturationnan,18978135,oxygen,stroke,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) leads to an increased right ventricular workload, cardiac failure and death. In idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) the vasodilating vasoactive intestinal peptide (aviptadil) is deficient. The aim of the present study was to test the acute effects on haemodynamics and blood gases, and the safety, of a single dose of inhaled aviptadil in chronic PH. A total of 20 patients with PH (PAH in nine, PH in lung disease in eight and chronic thromboembolic PH in three) inhaled a single 100-microg dose of aviptadil during right-heart catheterisation. Haemodynamics and blood gases were measured. Aviptadil aerosol caused a small and temporary but significant selective pulmonary vasodilation, an improved stroke volume and mixed venous oxygen saturation. Overall, six patients experienced a pulmonary vascular resistance reduction of >20%. In patients with significant lung disease, aviptadil tended to improve oxygenation. The pulmonary vasodilating effect of aviptadil aerosol was modest and short-lived, did not cause any side-effects and led to a reduced workload of the right ventricle without affecting systemic blood pressure. Aviptadil inhalation tended to improve oxygenation in patients with significant lung disease. Further studies are needed to evaluate the full therapeutic potential of aviptadil aerosol, including higher doses and chronic treatment."

Although the epileptic seizures were well controlled, she sometimes had a fever and hypokalemia from the age of 13 years. Laboratory examinations revealed metabolic acidosis, hypouricemia, hypophosphatemia, glycosuria, proteinuria and aminoaciduria, thus suggesting Fanconi syndrome. Gallium scanning showed marked renal uptake. A renal biopsy revealed interstitial nephritis without immuno-deposition. SV was replaced since it was considered to be the most probable cause of the renal involvement. Thereafter, she showed marked improvement of the clinical symptoms and the laboratory data gradually, and she never had a fever. Although SV is an effective anti-epileptic drug, we have to pay attention to adverse renal effects such as Fanconi syndrome and interstitial nephritis."

Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the trial. Allocation of patients into coumadin or aspirin groups depended upon the patients' choice. Nineteen patients were given coumadin at the adjusted dosage to maintain the therapeutic range of International Normalised Ratio between 1.5-3. Sixty patients were given aspirin at the fixed dosage of 75 mg per day. Six patients were lost to follow-up over the 3 yr period; four in the aspirin group and 2 in the coumadin group. There were three patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke in the aspirin group but none in the coumadin group after three years of follow-up. Six patients had mitral valve replacement during the study (i.e. three patients in each group). There were complications in 12 patients, 10 in the aspirin (16.6 per cent) and 2 in the coumadin (10.5 per cent) group. The complications in coumadin group were minor bleeding over the thigh in one patient and generalised ecchymosis over the whole body in one other. In the aspirin group, the complication was gastrointestional symptoms, mainly epigastric pain, but no frank bleeding was observed. Primary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in chronic rheumatic heart disease was found to be more effective with coumadin than aspirin. Our study does not support the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiac embolism in chronic rheumatic heart disease."

Previous studies in immunocompetent hosts and normal adults have demonstrated the value of intravenous acyclovir in the treatment of varicella-zoster virus infections. Oral acyclovir has also shown efficacy in both normal adults with zoster (shingles) and immunocompetent children with varicella. A recently completed double-blind placebo-controlled study of oral acyclovir in immunocompetent adults with uncomplicated varicella also demonstrated efficacy. Therapy within the first day reduced the time to 100% crusting of skin lesions from 7.4 to 5.6 days, and reduced the duration of fever by one-half day. Symptoms were also diminished. These benefits were observed only when therapy was initiated within 24 hours of the appearance of the rash. Adults with complicated varicella (usually symptomatic varicella pneumonia) should receive intravenous acyclovir. Several new agents for varicella-zoster therapy are being evaluated; brovavir is a new agent currently being compared to placebo in the treatment of adult varicella."

False,investigated therapeutic potential tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosisinducing ligand trailapol combination proteasome inhibitor bortezomib velcade human escc cell linesnan,20515944,bortezomib/Velcade,ESCC,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most aggressive human cancers, and novel treatment modalities are required. We investigated the therapeutic potential of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) in combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) on human ESCC cell lines. Bortezomib enhanced the susceptibility to TRAIL in 12 of the 15 ESCC cell lines tested, although most showed low sensitivity to TRAIL as a single agent. The enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by bortezomib was caspase dependent. Increased processing of caspase-8 often accompanied enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by bortezomib. However, the increased cell surface expression of death receptors observed on bortezomib treatment did not seem to be crucial for this effect. For some ESCC, bortezomib treatment resulted in a more efficient recruitment of caspase-8 and the Fas-associated death domain to the death-inducing signaling complex. Additional downregulation of the cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein long isoform [c-FLIP(L)] could cooperate in the activation of the extrinsic pathway in some cases. For other ESCC, the crucial effect of bortezomib treatment seemed to be increased signaling via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway on subsequent exposure to TRAIL. Thus, bortezomib could sensitize ESCC to TRAIL apoptosis by multiple molecular mechanisms of action. Therefore, the combination of bortezomib and TRAIL might be a novel therapeutic strategy for ESCC patients who fail to respond to standard chemoradiotherapy that predominantly targets the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway."
True,aviptadil aerosol caused small temporary significant selective pulmonary vasodilation improved stroke volume mixed venous oxygen saturationnan,18978135,Aviptadil,stroke,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) leads to an increased right ventricular workload, cardiac failure and death. In idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) the vasodilating vasoactive intestinal peptide (aviptadil) is deficient. The aim of the present study was to test the acute effects on haemodynamics and blood gases, and the safety, of a single dose of inhaled aviptadil in chronic PH. A total of 20 patients with PH (PAH in nine, PH in lung disease in eight and chronic thromboembolic PH in three) inhaled a single 100-microg dose of aviptadil during right-heart catheterisation. Haemodynamics and blood gases were measured. Aviptadil aerosol caused a small and temporary but significant selective pulmonary vasodilation, an improved stroke volume and mixed venous oxygen saturation. Overall, six patients experienced a pulmonary vascular resistance reduction of >20%. In patients with significant lung disease, aviptadil tended to improve oxygenation. The pulmonary vasodilating effect of aviptadil aerosol was modest and short-lived, did not cause any side-effects and led to a reduced workload of the right ventricle without affecting systemic blood pressure. Aviptadil inhalation tended to improve oxygenation in patients with significant lung disease. Further studies are needed to evaluate the full therapeutic potential of aviptadil aerosol, including higher doses and chronic treatment."
True,propose hypothesis forebrain nmda receptors play important role persistent inflammatory pain reenforcing glutamate sensory transmission brainnan,12598926,NMDA,inflammatory pain,"Glutamate is a fast excitatory transmitter in mammalian brains. Glutamatergic synapses are found in central regions related to pain transmission, plasticity and modulation. Glutamate NMDA receptors in forebrain structures are well known to contribute to the formation and storage of information. Here we propose the hypothesis that forebrain NMDA receptors play an important role in persistent inflammatory pain by re-enforcing glutamate sensory transmission in the brain. Mice with enhanced function of forebrain NMDA receptors demonstrate selective enhancement of persistent pain and allodynia. Drugs targeting forebrain NMDA NR2B receptors may serve as a new class of medicine to control persistent pain in humans."

We have focused our discussion on the impact of 5-HT(2C) receptors on the effects of different classes of addictive drugs, illustrated by reference to data using pharmacological and genetic tools. The neurochemical mechanism of the interaction between 5-HT(2C) receptors, with focus on the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, and drugs of abuse (using cocaine as an example) is discussed. Finally, we integrate recent nonclinical and clinical research and information with marketed products possessing 5-HT(2C) receptor binding affinities. Accordingly, available nonclinical data and some clinical observations targeting 5-HT(2C) receptors may offer innovative translational strategies for combating drug dependence.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Brain Integration."

False,results demonstrate cisplatincaused hemosiderin deposition spleen provides valuable clue understanding molecular basis toxicity cisplatin hemosiderin accumulation iron metabolism vivonan,20540689,iron,toxicity,"Cisplatin is one of the commonly-used chemotherapeutic drugs to efficiently treat malignant tumors in clinic, however, the adverse effects of cisplatin such as nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and hemolytic uremic syndrome are often observed at its clinical doses (approximately 60 mg/m(2)), which limit its broader application. In earlier studies, little attention was paid to the subtle changes in the architecture of lymphatic organs after low doses of cisplatin treatment. This paper reviews current understanding of cisplatin-induced erythrocyte injury, and presents our latest finding that a low dose of cisplatin (3.6 mg/m(2)/day, 14 days) could induce specific hemosiderin deposition in spleen of both normal and hepatoma-22 (H22) inoculated Balb/C mice. This dose of cisplatin significantly inhibited H22-induced acute ascites development. No significant toxicity was induced by this dose of cisplatin to tissues except for hemosiderin accumulation in the spleen of both normal and H22 tumor-bearing mice. Increased splenic iron content and erythrocyte injury were observed after treatment with the low dose of cisplatin. The mRNA levels of ferroportin (FPN1) and ferritin were upregulated by 25 and 5-fold in spleen, respectively. Overexpression of FPN1 and ferritin protein were also been observed at protein levels by Western blotting analysis. In addition, the mRNA expression of hepcidin was also increased, suggesting blockage of iron recycling through FPN1 in spleen with cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, cisplatin treatment damages the erythrocytes which accumulate in the red pulp of spleen with defective recycling of FPN1 and ferritin protein. Hepcidin inhibits the function of FPN1 as iron-exporter leading to iron overloaded inside ferritins of splenic cells, which are stained with abnormal hemosiderin accumulation. These results demonstrate that cisplatin-caused hemosiderin deposition in spleen provides a valuable clue for understanding the molecular basis of toxicity of cisplatin and hemosiderin accumulation and iron metabolism in vivo."

False,four doubleblind trials relapsingremitting ms demonstrated ivig may reduce relapse rate progression number gadolinium enhancing lesionsnan,12453069,gadolinium,MS,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has several effects on the immune system that could have a beneficial influence on disease processes in multiple sclerosis (MS). Four double-blind trials in relapsing-remitting MS have demonstrated that IVIG may reduce the relapse rate, progression and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions. However, these trials were smaller than the pivotal trials of interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate, and therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of the four trials in order to provide an overall assessment of the benefits of IVIG in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in comparison with other drugs currently available for treatment of disease activity in MS. The meta-analysis showed a significant beneficial effect on the annual relapse rate (effect size -0.5; P = 0.00003), on the proportion of relapse-free patients (0.29 difference; P = 2.1 x 10(-8)), change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score (effect size: 0.25; P = 0.04), and a trend towards a reduction in the proportion of patients who deteriorated (P = 0.03). Each single study in the meta-analysis had its weaknesses, but all studies were positive regarding their primary end-point, and the results yield concordant evidence for reduction of relapse rate and progression. The ideal dosage of IVIG for treating MS needs still to be determined. In conclusion, IVIG may be a valuable alternative for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS, but can presently not be considered as a first-line treatment. IVIG could be considered in patients who do not tolerate or are unwilling to take the approved injectable medications, but additional studies are needed to establish the role of IVIG in the management of multiple sclerosis."
True,compound also reported active convulsions induced bicuculline picrotoxin strychninenan,11060714,bicuculline,convulsions,"Zaleplon (N-[3-(3-cyanopyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidin-7-yl) phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide) is a non-benzodiazepine recently introduced for clinical use. This agent is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Preclinical studies have shown that the benzodiazepines triazolam and Ro17-1812 can substitute for zaleplon in animals trained to distinguish zaleplon from saline. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can antagonise the discriminative stimulus effect of zaleplon. These findings suggest that zaleplon is recognised by animals as a benzodiazepine agent. Zaleplon is active after ip. and oral administration in a variety of motor performance tests, including locomotor activity, rotarod and the loaded grid. Zaleplon has been shown to be active in a number of different anticonvulsant models, including the pentylenetetrazole, isoniazid and electroshock models. The compound is also reported to be active against convulsions induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin and strychnine. Studies in anxiolytic models suggest that zaleplon may have weak anxiolytic activity. From preclinical studies, it appears zaleplon possesses a reduced risk of tolerance compared to triazolam, is less likely to potentiate the effects of ethanol and is unlikely to produce amnestic effects. In man, zaleplon is rapidly absorbed and undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism. The compound has a plasma half-life of approximately one hour and is metabolised primarily via the aldehyde oxidase system to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. This metabolite, along with other minor metabolites formed in vivo, do not appear to contribute to the activity of zaleplon. Metabolites of zaleplon are excreted primarily via the urine. Phase I studies suggest that single daytime doses of zaleplon up to 15 mg are well-tolerated. Short-term impairment of performance occurs when zaleplon is administered during the day at doses epsilon 20 mg. However, given the short half-life of the compound, significant impairment of daytime performance is unlikely if zaleplon is administered at bedtime or shortly after retiring for the evening. Results from Phase II/III studies suggest that zaleplon (5 - 20 mg) produces a dose-dependent reduction in sleep latency in patients suffering from primary insomnia. The clinical efficacy of zaleplon persists for at least four weeks at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. Studies in patients with a history of drug abuse suggest that the abuse potential of zaleplon (at doses above the therapeutic dose range) is similar to that seen with the benzodiazepine triazolam."

False,inhibition cottlp oncogene aml cells reduces erk activation upregulates pkip concomitant enhancement differentiation cell cycle arrest induced silibinin dihydroxyvitaminnan,21084834,silibinin,AML,"Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a disease characterized by dysregulated cell proliferation associated with impaired cell differentiation, and current treatment regimens rarely save the patient. Thus, new mechanism-based approaches are needed to improve prognosis of this disease. We have investigated in preclinical studies the potential anti-leukemia use of the plant-derived polyphenol Silibinin (SIL) in combination with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D). Although most of the leukemic blasts ex vivo responded by differentiation to treatment with this combination, the reasons for the absence of SIL-1,25D synergy in some cases were unclear. Here we report that failure of SIL to enhance the action of 1,25D is likely due to the SIL-induced increase in the activity of differentiation-antagonizing cell components, such as ERK5. This kinase is under the control of Cot1/Tlp2, and inhibition of Cot1 activity by a specific pharmacological inhibitor 4-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenylamino)-6-(pyridin-3-yl-methylamino-3-cyano-[1-7]-naphthyridine, or by Cot1 siRNA, increases the differentiation by SIL/1,25D combinations. Conversely, over-expression of a Cot1 construct increases the cellular levels of P-ERK5, and SIL/1,25D-induced differentiation and cell cycle arrest are diminished. It appears that reduction in ERK5 activity by inhibition of Cot1 allows SIL to augment the expression of 1,25D-induced differentiation promoting factors and cell cycle regulators such as p27 (Kip1) , which leads to cell cycle arrest. This study shows that in some cell contexts SIL/1,25D can promote expression of both differentiation-promoting and differentiation-inhibiting genes, and that the latter can be neutralized by a highly specific pharmacological inhibitor, suggesting a potential for supplementing treatment of AML with this combination of agents."
False,azithromycin together monthly subgingival debridement treatment case severe chronic periodontitis poorly controlled diabetic complicated gingival overgrowth related medication calcium channel blockernan,20604763,calcium,diabetic,"Azithromycin, first synthesized in 1980, is a macrolide antibiotic related to erythromycin. It is widely used by the medical profession as a broad-spectrum antibiotic in the treatment of pneumonia, urinary tract infections and tonsillitis. In addition to its antibiotic properties, azithromycin has immune-modulating effects and is used for this reason in the management of cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. The drug is taken up by neutrophils, macrophages and fibroblasts, and is slowly released by these cells. Three diverse case reports are presented in which a single course of azithromycin (consisting of one 500 mg tablet being taken a day for three days) was prescribed before any periodontal intervention occurred. Azithromycin was the principal mode of treatment of severe chronic and aggressive periodontitis in Cases 1 and 2. Azithromycin, together with monthly subgingival debridement, was the treatment in Case 3 (severe chronic periodontitis in a poorly controlled diabetic complicated by gingival overgrowth related to medication with a calcium channel blocker). Favourable resolution of inflammation, reduction in pocket depths and evidence of bone regeneration were evident, even when no periodontal treatment had occurred. In Case 3, resolution of gingival overgrowth occurred over eight months. The potential implications for periodontal management, understanding of the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases and periodontal research are briefly discussed."

False,ep shown decrease expression various proinflammatory mediators including nitric oxide  tumor necrosis factor tnf cyclooxygenase interleukin il variety vitro vivo model systemsnan,16226725,nitric oxide/NO,tumor,"Ethyl pyruvate (EP) is a simple aliphatic ester derived from the endogenous metabolite, pyruvic acid. EP has been shown to decrease the expression of various pro-inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO*), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cyclooxygenase-2, and interleukin (IL)-6, in a variety of in vitro and in vivo model systems. In an effort to better understand the chemical features that might explain the anti-inflammatory properties of EP, we screened 15 commercially available compounds for cytoprotective or anti-inflammatory effects using two in vitro assay systems: TNF and NO* production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophage-like cells and changes in the permeability of Caco-2 human enterocyte-like monolayers stimulated with a cocktail of pro-inflammatory cytokines called cytomix (1000U/ml IFN-gamma plus 10ng/ml TNF-alpha plus 1ng/ml IL-1beta). Two compounds, namely diethyl oxaloproprionate (DEOP) and 2-acetamidoacrylate (2AA), demonstrated consistent anti-inflammatory or cytoprotective pharmacological properties in this screening process. Treatment of mice with either of these compounds ameliorated LPS-induced ileal mucosal hyperpermeability to the fluorescent probe, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (average molecular mass 4kDa), and bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes. Treatment with either of these compounds also improved survival in mice challenged with a lethal dose of LPS. Finally, in a study that compared 2AA to its methyl ester, we showed that methyl-2-acetamidoacrylate is at least 100-fold more potent than the parent carboxylate as an inhibitor of LPS-induced NO* production by RAW 264.7 cells. Collectively, these data are consistent with the view that anti-inflammatory activity is demonstrable for a number of compounds that either incorporate an olefinic linkage conjugated to a carbonyl moiety or are capable of undergoing tautomeric rearrangement to form such a structure. Moreover, our findings suggest that esters with these general characteristics, perhaps because of their greater lipophilicity or electrophilicity, are more potent anti-inflammatory agents than are the parent carboxylates."

False,transdermal fentanyl administered cautiously patients preexisting conditions emphysema may predispose development hypoventilationnan,14583070,fentanyl,emphysema,"Transdermal fentanyl is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of chronic pain caused by malignancy and non-malignant conditions when administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Compared with oral opioids, the advantages of transdermal fentanyl include a lower incidence and impact of adverse effects (constipation, nausea and vomiting, and daytime drowsiness), a higher degree of patient satisfaction, improved quality of life, improved convenience and compliance resulting from administration every 72 hours, and decreased use of rescue medication. Transdermal fentanyl is a useful analgesic for cancer patients who are unable to swallow or have gastrointestinal problems. Transdermal fentanyl forms a depot within the upper skin layers before entering the microcirculation. Therapeutic blood levels are attained 12-16 hours after patch application and decrease slowly with a half-life of 16-22 hours following removal. Patients with chronic pain should be titrated to adequate relief with short-acting oral or parenteral opioids prior to the initiation of transdermal fentanyl in order to prevent exacerbations of pain or opioid-related adverse effects. Transdermal fentanyl can then be initiated based on the 24-hour opioid requirement once adequate analgesia has been achieved. The prolonged elimination of transdermal fentanyl can become problematic if patients develop opioid-related adverse effects, especially hypoventilation. Adverse effects do not improve immediately after patch removal and may take many hours to resolve. Patients who experience opioid-related toxicity associated with respiratory depression should be treated immediately with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone and closely monitored for at least 24 hours. Because of the short half-life of naloxone, sequential doses or a continuous infusion of the opioid antagonist may be necessary. Transdermal fentanyl should be administered cautiously to patients with pre-existing conditions such as emphysema that may predispose them to the development of hypoventilation. Transdermal fentanyl is indicated only for patients who require continuous opioid administration for the treatment of chronic pain that cannot be managed with other medications. It is contraindicated in the management of acute and postoperative pain, as pain may decrease more rapidly in these circumstances than fentanyl blood levels can be adjusted, leading to the development of life-threatening hypoventilation. Cognitive and physical impairments such as confusion and abnormal co-ordination can occur with transdermal fentanyl. Therefore, patients should be instructed to refrain from driving or operating machinery immediately following the initiation of transdermal fentanyl, or after any dosage increase. Patients may resume such activities once the absence of these potential adverse effects is documented."

However, it is not certain as to the following: (a) what receptors were stimulated by the ACTH N-terminal fragments at the LC that resulted in this disorder; (b) whether NE, released onto Purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway, did indeed cause the long-term depression at Purkinje cell synapses (previously described by others) that resulted in the long duration of the movement disorder; (c) whether the inhibition of inhibitory Purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei, the output targets of the Purkinje cell axons, that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder. These questions are currently being investigated."
True,protective role manganese superoxide dismutase adriamycin induced acute cardiac toxicity transgenic micenan,8787689,adriamycin,acute cardiac toxicity,"Adriamycin (ADR) is a potent anticancer drug known to cause severe cardiac toxicity. Although ADR generates free radicals, the role of free radicals in the development of cardiac toxicity and the intracellular target for ADR-induced cardiac toxicity are still not well understood. We produced three transgenic mice lines expressing increased levels of human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial enzyme, as an animal model to investigate the role of ADR-mediated free radical generation in mitochondria. The human MnSOD was expressed, functionally active, and properly transported into mitochondria in the heart of transgenic mice. The levels of copper-zinc SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase did not change in the transgenic mice. Electron microscopy revealed dose-dependent ultrastructural alterations with marked mitochondrial damage in nontransgenic mice treated with ADR, but not in the transgenic littermates. Biochemical analysis indicated that the levels of serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in ADR-treated mice were significantly greater in nontransgenic than their transgenic littermates expressing a high level of human MnSOD after ADR treatment. These results support a major role for free radical generation in ADR toxicity as well as suggesting mitochondria as the critical site of cardiac injury."

To determine the incidence rates of thrombotic adverse events (AEs) after infusion of rFVIIa and FEIBA. Data from the MedWatch pharmacovigilance program of the US Food and Drug Administration, as supplemented by published case reports, were used in conjunction with estimated numbers of infusions available from manufacturers to assess comparative incidence of thrombotic AEs in patients receiving rFVIIa or FEIBA in the period from April 1999 through June 2002. Reported thrombotic AEs were rare, with incidence rates of 24.6 per 10(5) infusions (CI, 19.1-31.2 per 10(5) infusions) for rFVIIa and 8.24 per 10(5) infusions (CI, 4.71-13.4 per 10(5) infusions) for FEIBA. Thrombotic AEs were significantly more frequent in rFVIIa than FEIBA recipients (incidence rate ratio, 2.98; CI, 1.71-5.52). The most commonly documented single type of thrombotic AE after rFVIIa infusion was cerebrovascular thrombosis, while myocardial infarction was the most frequent type in patients receiving FEIBA. Contrasting AE reporting patterns between rFVIIa and FEIBA may have contributed to the observed difference in thrombotic event incidence. Nevertheless, this comprehensive pharmacovigilance assessment does not support superior thrombotic safety of rFVIIa and suggests that thrombotic AE risk may be higher in rFVIIa than FEIBA recipients."

Before treatment, there were no significant differences in the above parameters between groups. After treatment, there was a similar significant decrease in blood pressure in both groups. Flow-mediated vasodilation increased significantly in the perindopril group compared with the amlodipine group; however, the decrease in brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was not significantly different between groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril is superior to the calcium channel blocker amlodipine for reducing vascular endothelial dysfunction when co-administered with angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with essential hypertension."
True,brouwer et al reported pauciimmune glomerulonephritis rats immunized human mpo followed perfusion kidneys lysosomal enzyme extract combined h2o2 suggested could serve model ancainduced diseasenan,8082301,H2O2,glomerulonephritis,"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), including anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies, are associated with pauci-immune necrotizing small vessel vasculitis or glomerulonephritis. In order to substantiate a pathogenic role for ANCA, an animal model of pauci-immune ANCA-induced glomerulonephritis or vasculitis is required. Brouwer et al. reported pauci-immune glomerulonephritis in rats immunized with human MPO followed by perfusion of kidneys with lysosomal enzyme extract combined with H2O2, and suggested that this could serve as a model of ANCA-induced disease. We repeated these studies in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Brown Norway rats (BNR). We immunized rats with human MPO. When circulating anti-MPO antibodies were detectable by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and ELISA, blood pressure was measured, then perfusion of the left kidney of each rat was done via the renal artery in a closed, blood-free circuit with either MPO + H2O2, MPO, H2O2 alone or MPO + H2O2 + neutral protease. Rats were killed on day 4 or day 10 after perfusion, and specimens were examined by light and immunofluorescence microscopy. Pathological lesions and deposits of IgG, C3, and MPO were found in immunized rats perfused with MPO + H2O2 with or without neutral protease, or MPO alone, in both rat strains and on both day 4 and day 10. The degree of histologic injury was proportional in intensity to the amount of IgG immune deposits. Spontaneously hypertensive rats sustained more damage and higher blood pressure than Brown Norway rats. No lesion was observed in immunized rats perfused with H2O2 or in the non-perfused right kidneys. Some of the non-immunized rats perfused with MPO + H2O2 developed pathological lesions. In conclusion, these rat models are examples of immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, and therefore are not similar to human ANCA-associated disease."

False,observed pegylation enhanced stability poly-sno-hsa vitro vivo dimerization poly-sno-hsa enhanced antitumor activity via efficient delivery colon tumor bearing micenan,24846171,Poly-SNO-HSA,tumor,"Macromolecules have been developed as carriers of low-molecular-weight drugs in drug delivery systems (DDS) to improve their pharmacokinetic profile or to promote their uptake in tumor tissue via enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects. We have previously demonstrated that poly-nitric oxide (NO) conjugated human serum albumin (Poly-SNO-HSA) has the potential to be a DDS carrier capable of accumulating NO in tumors. However, the stability of Poly-SNO-HSA in the circulation has to be improved, and its optimal molecular size for using the EPR effects has to be evaluated. In the present study, we performed two tuning methods for refining Poly-SNO-HSA, namely, pegylation and dimerization. We observed that pegylation enhanced the stability of Poly-SNO-HSA both in vitro and in vivo, and that dimerization of Poly-SNO-HSA enhanced the antitumor activity via more efficient delivery of NO in Colon 26 tumor-bearing mice. Intriguingly, dimerization resulted in a 10 times higher antitumor activity. These data suggest that pegylation and dimerization of Poly-SNO-HSA are very important tuners to optimize NO stability and accumulation, and thereby effect, in tumors. Thus, polyethylene glycol-Poly-SNO-HSA dimer seems to be a very appealing and safe NO carrier and thereby a strong candidate as an antitumor drug in future development of cancer therapeutics."

True,ketanserinresistant components 5-ht induced contractions found log ec  nm ketanserin log ec  nm ketanserinnan,8789380,5-HT,contractions,"1. We investigated the hypothesis that, as in some other large human arteries, 5-HT-induced contraction of the temporal artery is mediated through two co-existing receptor populations, 5-HT1-like- and 5-HT2A. Temporal arterial segments were obtained from patients undergoing brain surgery and rings prepared set up to contract with 5-HT and related agents. Fractions of maximal 5-HT responses mediated through 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2A receptors, f1 and f2 = 1-f1, were estimated by use of the 5-HT2A-selective antagonist ketanserin. 2. In rings with intact endothelium 5-HT evoked contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.0. Ketanserin (10-1000 nM) antagonized part of the 5-HT-induced contractions. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M of 6.9 and f1 of 0.17 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 6.4 and f1 of 0.20 (1000 nM ketanserin). 3. In rings with endothelial function attenuated by enzymatic treatment, 5-HT caused contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.2 that were partially blocked by ketanserin. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M 7.4 and f1 of 0.16 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 7.5 and f1 of 0.14 (1000 nM ketanserin). 4. The ketanserin-resistant component of 5-HT-evoked contraction was blocked by methiothepin (100-1000 nM) consistent with mediation through 5-HT1-like receptors. 5. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT1-like-selective agonist, sumatriptan, caused small contractions with a -log EC50, M of 6.5 and intrinsic activity of 0.21 with respect to 5-HT that were resistant to blockade by 1000 nM ketanserin but antagonized by 100 nM methiothepin. 6. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT2A receptor partial agonist SK&F 103829 (2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-8[methyl sulphonyl]-1H3-benzazepin-7-ol methensulphonate) contracted rings with a -log EC50, M of 5.0 and an intrinsic activity of 0.49 with respect to 5-HT; the effects were antagonized by ketanserin 1000 nM. 7. We conclude that 80-86% of the maximum 5-HT-evoked contraction of human temporal artery is mediated through 5-HT2A receptors, the remainder through 5-HT1-like-receptors, regardless of whether or not endothelium is functional. The 5-HT1-like-receptors are more likely to be 5-HT1D beta receptors than 5-HT1D alpha receptors and sumatriptan is a full agonist for these receptors. As found in arteries of other species, SK&F 103829 is a partial agonist for 5-HT2A receptors of human temporal artery."
False,new tubulin polymerization inhibitor auristatin pe induces tumor regression human waldenstroms macroglobulinemia xenograft modelnan,10402249,auristatin PE,Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,"Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is an uncommon lymphoproliferative disease which remains incurable with current treatment protocols. We have previously established a permanent WM cell line, WSU-WM, which grows as a xenograft in severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of auristatin PE (a structural modification of the marine, shell-less mollusk peptide constituent dolastatin 10). WSU-WM cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 at a concentration of 2x10(5) cells/ml using 24-well plates. Auristatin PE or dolastatin 10 were added to triplicate wells and cell count and viability were assessed after 24, 48 and 72 h. Results showed that both agents were active against WSU-WM, and were able to induce complete growth inhibition at 100 pg/ml. The efficacy of these agents in vivo was evaluated using the WSU-WM SCID mouse xenograft model. Auristatin PE and dolastatin 10 were given i.v. via tail vein at 2.0 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively. The agents were given every second day for three injections which represent the maximum tolerated doses. Tumor growth inhibition (T/C), tumor growth delay (T-C), and log10 kill for auristatin PE and dolastatin 10 were 0%, 18 days, 2.83 and 67%, 2 days, 0.06, respectively. Based on these animal results, dolastatin 10 was inactive while auristatin PE was highly active. We therefore focused further investigation on auristatin PE to understand some of its mechanisms of action. Using two flow cytometry assays, propidium iodide for cell cycle analysis and 7-amino actinomycin D (7AAD) to detect apoptosis, we were able to demonstrate that auristatin PE at 10 pg/ml after 24 h arrested 50% of WSU-MW cells in G2M. Concomitantly, 31% of auristatin PE-treated cells entered apoptosis. By 72 h, greater than 75% of the cells became apoptotic. The activity of auristatin PE should be evaluated in other tumor types and in clinical trials."
False,real time data confirm vivo humans hcv infection pathways related fatty acids glucose metabolism free radical scavenging inhibitednan,23529134,fatty acids,HCV infection,"Lipid pathway impairment, decrease in the antioxidant pool and downregulation in amino-acid metabolism are just some of the metabolic variations attributed to chronic HCV infection. All of them have been studied separately, mainly in animal models. Thanks to proteomic analysis we managed to describe (for the fist time to the best of our knowledge), in vivo and in humans, the metabolic alterations caused by HCV, and the recovery of the same alterations during HCV treatment. We performed proteomic analysis on liver specimens of a 28-year-old woman affected by hepatitis C genotype 1a, alcoholism and diabetes mellitus type 1, before and after antiviral treatment with pegylated interferon alpha 2b and ribavirin. The subject, thanks to a patient-tailored therapy, reached Sustained Virological Response. Throughout the treatment period the patient was monitored with subsequent biochemical, clinical and psychological examinations. The data obtained by the patient's close monitoring suggest a direct interaction between insulin resistance and an active HCV genotype 1 infection, with a leading role played by the infection, and not by insulin resistance, as demonstrated by the sharp fall of the insulin units needed per day during treatment. The proteomic analysis showed that after therapy, a downregulation of enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and alcohol catabolism takes place, the latter probably due to cessation of alcohol abuse. On the contrary, the metabolic pathways linked to metabolism of the reactive oxygen species were upregulated after therapy. Finally, a significant alteration in the pathway regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA), a major regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver, was reported. These ""real time"" data confirm in vivo, in humans, that during HCV infection, the pathways related to fatty acids, glucose metabolism and free radical scavenging are inhibited. The same enzyme deficit is completely recovered after HCV eradication."

False,active principle marijuana deltatetrahydrocannabinol thc shown wide therapeutic application number important medical conditions including pain anxiety glaucoma nausea emesis muscle spasms wasting diseasesnan,11448725,Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol/THC,Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol/THC,"The active principle in marijuana, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has been shown to have wide therapeutic application for a number of important medical conditions, including pain, anxiety, glaucoma, nausea, emesis, muscle spasms, and wasting diseases. Delta(9)-THC binds to and activates two known cannabinoid receptors found in mammalian tissue, CB1 and CB2. The development of cannabinoid-based therapeutics has focused predominantly on the CB1 receptor, based on its predominant and abundant localization in the CNS. Like most of the known cannabinoid agonists, Delta(9)-THC is lipophilic and relatively nonselective for both receptor subtypes. Clinical studies show that nonselective cannabinoid agonists are relatively safe and provide therapeutic efficacy, but that they also induce psychotropic side effects. Recent studies of the biosynthesis, release, transport, and disposition of anandamide are beginning to provide an understanding of the role of lipid transmitters in the CNS. This review attempts to link current understanding of the basic biology of the endocannabinoid nervous system to novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention. This new knowledge may facilitate the development of cannabinoid receptor-targeted therapeutics with improved safety and efficacy profiles."

This section of the compendium initially addresses two classically described inhaled gases: carbon monoxide and cyanide, followed by a discussion of a gas associated with illicit drug use: metamphetamine. Understanding the varying effects of the toxic gases at the scene of injury may facilitate the development of specific treatment regimens for inhalation injury."
True,randomised clinical trials observational studies shown increased risk myocardial infarction stroke hypertension heart failure treatment cyclooxygenase inhibitors nan,16586083,cyclooxygenase inhibitors,heart failure,"Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with concomitant risk factors. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal, vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time. A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance-specific differences, which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin-independent effects. Diagnostic markers such as N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or high-sensitive C-reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity."

We describe a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) associated with the use of ziprasidone. Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with NMS, atypical antipsychotic drugs like ziprasidone may also be a cause. The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia who developed signs and symptoms of NMS after 2 days of treatment with an 80-mg/day dose of orally administrated ziprasidone. This case is the earliest (second day of treatment) NMS due to ziprasidone reported in the literature."
False,conclusion results suggest angiotensin iconverting enzyme inhibitor perindopril superior calcium channel blocker amlodipine reducing vascular endothelial dysfunction coadministered angiotensin receptor blockers patients essential hypertensionnan,18971536,perindopril,vascular endothelial dysfunction,"The combination of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers has been shown to be more effective than the individual drugs alone in the treatment of chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine or the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on vascular endothelial function and arteriosclerosis in patients with essential hypertension who had already been receiving angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy. Thirty-two patients with essential hypertension treated with angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy were randomized to receive 5 mg of amlodipine (n=16) or 4 mg of perindopril (n=16) once daily in the morning for 24 weeks. The patients were evaluated before and after therapy to assess changes in blood pressure, flow-mediated vasodilation (a parameter of vascular endothelial function), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (a parameter of arteriosclerosis). Before treatment, there were no significant differences in the above parameters between groups. After treatment, there was a similar significant decrease in blood pressure in both groups. Flow-mediated vasodilation increased significantly in the perindopril group compared with the amlodipine group; however, the decrease in brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was not significantly different between groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril is superior to the calcium channel blocker amlodipine for reducing vascular endothelial dysfunction when co-administered with angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with essential hypertension."
True,inhaled silicate dusts may cause lung disease surface coordination iron subsequent oxidant generation via fenton reactionnan,1977006,silicate,lung disease,"Inhaled silicate dusts may cause lung disease through their surface coordination of iron with subsequent oxidant generation via the Fenton reaction. Pneumoconiosis, irritant bronchitis, focal emphysema, and carcinoma may be produced by oxidants either directly through lipid peroxidation and protein inactivation, or indirectly by oxidant-mediated release of cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor. The increased incidence of tuberculosis observed among silicate workers could be explained by accumulation of iron complexed by dust particles in the lung and made available to dormant mycobacteria as a virulence factor."
False,inhibitory effects tea carcinogenesis attributed biologic activities polyphenol fraction teanankey term,10786933,polyphenol,carcinogenesis,"Tea is one of the most widely consumed beverages, second only to water. Many experimental researches in laboratory animals demonstrated that tea components had an inhibitory effect on carcinogenesis at a number of organ sites. The inhibitory effects of tea against carcinogenesis have been attributed to the biologic activities of the polyphenol fraction in tea. This review summarizes experimental data on chemopreventive effects of tea polyphenols in various tumor bioassay systems. Many laboratory studies have demonstrated the inhibitory effects of green tea polyphenols, especially (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), on carcinogenesis in animals models. The majority of these studies have been conducted in mouse skin tumor models, where tea polyphenols were used either as oral feeding in drinking water or in direct local application. Most studies used 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or ultraviolet (UV) radiation as the tumor promoter and found anticarcinogenic effects caused by green tea polyphenols. Black tea was also found to be effective, although the activity was weaker than that of green tea in some experiments. Other studies showed that black tea polyphenols-theaflavins exhibited stronger anticarcinogenic activity than did EGCG. Caffeine in tea was also important for tea to prevent tumorigenesis. The molecular mechanisms of the cancer chemopreventive effects of tea polyphenols are not completely understood. They are most likely related to the mechanisms of biochemical actions of tea polyphenols, which include antioxidative activities, modulation of xenobiotic metabolite enzymes and inhibition of tumor promotion. In addition, we have also proposed that tea polyphenols function as cancer chemopreventive agents through modulation of mitotic signal transduction. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this modulation need further investigation."

The electrophysiological studies revealed a demyelinating motor-sensory neuropathy. The serum vitamin E level was low. Sural nerve biopsy revealed loss of large myelinated fibers with evidence of remyelination. Vitamin E supplementation led to clinical and electrophysiological recovery of sensory conduction and evoked potentials. Motor nerve conduction, however, showed only partial recovery. Vitamin E deficiency leading to a demyelinating neuropathy, as in the present case, suggests that the full spectrum of the disease entity is not fully defined."

False,examined antiretroviral resistance among cohort south african hiv-infected children nevirapine prevention mothertochild transmissionnan,21345162,nevirapine,HIV-infected,"Data on the development of antiretroviral drug resistance in HIV-1-infected children receiving protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) are limited. We examined antiretroviral resistance among a cohort of 323 South African HIV-infected children <2 years old exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Ritonavir (RTV) was used initially for 138 children who were <6 months old or receiving antimycobacterial therapy; otherwise children received lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based ART. HIV-1 population sequencing of the pol gene was conducted on all pretreatment samples and on posttreatment samples for children who did not achieve HIV-1 plasma RNA <400 copies/ml by 52 weeks. Among children in the cohort, 38 died, 22 had <24 weeks follow-up, 209 achieved virologic suppression, and 54 did not. Of 41 children without virologic suppression with posttreatment HIV genotype data available, major resistance mutations were found in 32 (78%): 14 (36%) had PI mutations including V82A, M46I, and L90M; 29 (71%) had M184V/I; and three had NNRTI mutations (K103N, Y181C, and G190A). Among the children who did not achieve virologic suppression, none of the seven children treated exclusively with LPV/r developed PI-related mutations, compared with 14 of 32 (44%) who received RTV-based regimens (p=0.036); PI genotypes were unavailable for two children. Seventy-eight percent of children without virologic suppression developed resistance mutations that impact second-line ART options. Only children who received RTV-based ART developed major PI-related resistance mutations, and use of this regimen should be avoided."

True,cisplatin one commonlyused chemotherapeutic drugs efficiently treat malignant tumors clinic however adverse effects cisplatin nephrotoxicity neurotoxicity hemolytic uremic syndrome often observed clinical doses approximately mgm limit broader applicationnan,20540689,Cisplatin,neurotoxicity,"Cisplatin is one of the commonly-used chemotherapeutic drugs to efficiently treat malignant tumors in clinic, however, the adverse effects of cisplatin such as nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and hemolytic uremic syndrome are often observed at its clinical doses (approximately 60 mg/m(2)), which limit its broader application. In earlier studies, little attention was paid to the subtle changes in the architecture of lymphatic organs after low doses of cisplatin treatment. This paper reviews current understanding of cisplatin-induced erythrocyte injury, and presents our latest finding that a low dose of cisplatin (3.6 mg/m(2)/day, 14 days) could induce specific hemosiderin deposition in spleen of both normal and hepatoma-22 (H22) inoculated Balb/C mice. This dose of cisplatin significantly inhibited H22-induced acute ascites development. No significant toxicity was induced by this dose of cisplatin to tissues except for hemosiderin accumulation in the spleen of both normal and H22 tumor-bearing mice. Increased splenic iron content and erythrocyte injury were observed after treatment with the low dose of cisplatin. The mRNA levels of ferroportin (FPN1) and ferritin were upregulated by 25 and 5-fold in spleen, respectively. Overexpression of FPN1 and ferritin protein were also been observed at protein levels by Western blotting analysis. In addition, the mRNA expression of hepcidin was also increased, suggesting blockage of iron recycling through FPN1 in spleen with cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, cisplatin treatment damages the erythrocytes which accumulate in the red pulp of spleen with defective recycling of FPN1 and ferritin protein. Hepcidin inhibits the function of FPN1 as iron-exporter leading to iron overloaded inside ferritins of splenic cells, which are stained with abnormal hemosiderin accumulation. These results demonstrate that cisplatin-caused hemosiderin deposition in spleen provides a valuable clue for understanding the molecular basis of toxicity of cisplatin and hemosiderin accumulation and iron metabolism in vivo."
True,ld dose mg doxorubicin kg ip administered day hfd feeding regimen led higher cardiotoxicity cardiac dysfunction lipid peroxidation mortality obese ob rats absence significant renal hepatic toxicitynan,18674790,doxorubicin,cardiac dysfunction,"Often, chemotherapy by doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is limited due to life threatening cardiotoxicity in patients during and posttherapy. Recently, we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and triglycerides and increased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation, ATP synthesis, and upregulated JAK/STAT3 pathway. In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high fat diet (HFD), which induces obesity in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. A LD(10) dose (8 mg doxorubicin/kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher cardiotoxicity, cardiac dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in the obese (OB) rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity. Doxorubicin toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol (toxic metabolite) in the normal diet-fed (ND) and OB hearts. Mechanistic studies revealed that OB rats are sensitized due to: (1) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, (2) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, (3) decreased plasma adiponectin levels, (4) decreased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation (666.9+/-14.0 nmol/min/g heart in ND versus 400.2+/-11.8 nmol/min/g heart in OB), (5) decreased mitochondrial AMP-alpha2 protein kinase, and (6) 86% drop in cardiac ATP levels accompanied by decreased ATP/ADP ratio after doxorubicin administration. Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK/STAT3 pathway. In conclusion, HFD-induced obese rats are highly sensitized to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial ATP generation, increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the JAK/STAT3 pathway."

We show that HER2/neu uses Akt to induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and that inhibition of Akt or COX-2 increases 4-HPR-induced apoptosis and nitric oxide production. Apoptosis induced by the 4-HPR and COX-2 inhibitor combination, although unaffected by an anti-HER2/neu antibody, was reversed by the COX-2 product prostaglandin E(2), indicating that COX-2 is a major mechanism by which HER2/neu suppresses 4-HPR apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Combining 4-HPR with COX-2 inhibitors may be a novel chemopreventive strategy against HER2/neu-overexpressing breast tumors."

We aimed to investigate the impact of the coadministration of TZD and ACEI/ARB on hematocrit and hemoglobin values in uncomplicated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal serum creatinine.Data from patients with type 2 diabetes currently followed, were reviewed and patients treated with ACEI/ARB and/or TZD were identified. For the purpose of this study the following 4 groups of 30 stable non-anemic diabetic patients each matched for age, gender, and BMI were formed. Group ACEI/ARB included patients on ACEI/ARB without TZD, group TZD included patients on TZD and antihypertensive agents other than ACEI/ARB, group ACEI/ARB/TZD consisted of patients on combined therapy with ACEI/ARB and TZD and the control group C included patients never exposed to ACEI/ARB or TZD. Clinical and laboratory data were collected prior to initiation of treatment and after 6 months.Neither hematocrit nor hemoglobin showed any significant change from baseline at the end of the study in group C. In both group ACEI/ARB and group TZD a small, but statistically significant reduction in hematocrit (~ 1% point) and hemoglobin levels (~ 0.3 g/dl) was seen. A greater statistically and clinically important reduction in hematocrit (~ 3% points) and hemoglobin (~ 1 g/dl) levels was observed in group  ACEI/ARB/TZD. Furthermore, incident anemia at the end reached 7% in group TZD and 23% in group ACEI/ARB/TZD.Coadministration of RAS inhibitors and PPAR-γ agonists should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hematocrit lowering and anemia in uncomplicated type 2 diabetic patients with normal serum creatinine. Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism(s), the cardiovascular consequences and the cost utility of anemia workup in such patients."

The hypoxia-activated pro-drug TH-302 may have selective toxicity for hypoxic and neighboring cells in tumors. Here we characterize the spatial distribution and ability of TH-302 to selectively target hypoxic regions and complement the effect of doxorubicin and docetaxel by modifying biomarker distribution. Athymic nude mice bearing human breast MCF-7 or prostate PC-3 tumors were treated with doxorubicin or docetaxel respectively and TH-302 alone or in combination. Biomarkers of drug effect including γH2aX (a marker of DNA damage), cleaved caspase-3 or -6 (markers of apoptosis) and reduction in Ki-67 (a marker of cell proliferation) were quantified in tumor sections in relation to functional blood vessels (recognized by DiOC7) and hypoxia (recognized by EF5) using immunohistochemistry. γH2aX expression at 10 min and cleaved caspase-3 or -6 at 24 hr after doxorubicin or docetaxel decreased with increasing distance from tumor blood vessels, with minimal expression in hypoxic regions; maximum reduction in Ki67 levels was observed in regions closest to vasculature at 24 hr. TH-302 induced maximal cell damage in hypoxic and neighboring regions, but was also active in tumor regions closer to blood vessels. TH-302 given 4 hr before doxorubicin or docetaxel increased DNA damage and apoptosis throughout the tumor compared to chemotherapy alone. When given with doxorubicin or docetaxel, TH-302 complements and enhances anticancer effects in both perivascular and hypoxic regions but also increases toxicity."

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine or the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on vascular endothelial function and arteriosclerosis in patients with essential hypertension who had already been receiving angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy. Thirty-two patients with essential hypertension treated with angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy were randomized to receive 5 mg of amlodipine (n=16) or 4 mg of perindopril (n=16) once daily in the morning for 24 weeks. The patients were evaluated before and after therapy to assess changes in blood pressure, flow-mediated vasodilation (a parameter of vascular endothelial function), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (a parameter of arteriosclerosis). Before treatment, there were no significant differences in the above parameters between groups. After treatment, there was a similar significant decrease in blood pressure in both groups. Flow-mediated vasodilation increased significantly in the perindopril group compared with the amlodipine group; however, the decrease in brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was not significantly different between groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril is superior to the calcium channel blocker amlodipine for reducing vascular endothelial dysfunction when co-administered with angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with essential hypertension."

False,although intravenous ribavirin effective children severe adenovirus disease series literature therapy unlikely benefit begun late course infectionnan,12093990,ribavirin,adenovirus disease,"Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host. The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia. The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity."
True,moreover alcohol abuse produce cardiac arrhythmias hypertension cardiomyopathy stroke even sudden deathnan,9751945,alcohol,hypertension,"The ingestion of one or two alcoholic drinks can affect heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, myocardial contractility, and regional blood flow. These actions generally are not clinically important. In the presence of cardiovascular disease, however, even such small quantities of alcohol might result in transient unfavorable hemodynamic changes. Moreover, alcohol abuse can produce cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, stroke, and even sudden death. In contrast, moderate alcohol use produces changes that have an overall favorable effect on atherosclerotic-related vascular diseases. Because cardiovascular disease due to atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in Western society, this desirable effect of alcohol use outweighs its detrimental actions, resulting in favorable findings in population studies. Nevertheless, the body of evidence argues against encouraging alcohol use for its cardiovascular effects."

False,two days low calorie diet reduces endogenous glucose production obese type diabetic patients despite withdrawal blood glucose lowering therapies including insulinnan,15931603,glucose,obese,"The mechanism of the blood glucose-lowering effect of a 2-day very low calorie diet (VLCD; 1890 kJ/d) in combination with the cessation of all blood glucose-lowering agents was studied in 12 (7 women, 5 men) obese (body mass index, 36.3 +/- 1.0 kg/m 2 [mean +/- SEM]) type 2 diabetic patients (age, 55 +/- 4 years; HbA 1c , 7.3% +/- 0.4%) undergoing insulin therapy. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) and whole body glucose disposal (6,6 2 H 2 -glucose), lipolysis ( 2 H 5 -glycerol), and substrate oxidation (indirect calorimetry) rates were measured before and after the intervention in basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions. After 2 days of a VLCD and discontinuation of all blood glucose-lowering therapies, fasting plasma glucose levels did not increase (11.3 +/- 1.3 vs 10.3 +/- 1.0 mmol/L). Basal EGP significantly declined (14.2 +/- 1.0 to 11.9 +/- 0.7 mu mol/kg per minute; P = .009). Basal metabolic clearance rate of glucose and rate of basal lipolysis did not change. During hyperinsulinemia, EGP (5.5 +/- 0.8 to 5.2 +/- 0.5 mu mol/kg per minute), whole body glucose disposal (12.1 +/- 0.7 to 11.3 +/- 1.0 mu mol/kg per minute), the metabolic clearance rate of glucose, and the rate of lipolysis did not change after the 2-day intervention. Cessation of blood glucose-lowering therapy in combination with a 2-day VLCD does not lead to hyperglycemia and is associated with a reduction in basal EGP. Insulin-stimulated whole body glucose disposal did not improve, nor did insulin suppressibility of EGP and lipolysis."

Ramosetron (0.3 to 100 microg/kg, p.o.) has been found to significantly suppress abnormal defecation induced by conditioned-fear stress (CFS), restraint stress, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and 5-HT in rats and mice, and these effects were more potent than those of alosetron, cilansetron or loperamide. On the other hand, ramosetron (3,000 microg/kg, p. o., once daily for 7 days) did not inhibit normal defecation in dogs while tiquizium significantly inhibited it. Ramosetron (3 to 100 microg/kg, p. o.) also significantly prevented CFS-induced acceleration of colonic transit and CRF-induced abnormal water transport in rats, respectively. Moreover, ramosetron (0.3 to 3 microg/kg, p. o.) significantly suppressed restraint stress-induced decrease in colonic pain threshold, an effect not observed with loperamide. These results indicate that ramosetron produce beneficial clinical effects on IBS symptoms."

A matched case control study was carried out. Fourteen patients (19% of screened patients) with VRE colonisation were identified (12 with Enterococcus faecium). All isolates manifested the Van A phenotype. Extensive environmental contamination with VRE was present. PFGE of E. faecium isolates from 10 patients and from five of six environmental cultures revealed patterns suggesting genetic relatedness. Following comparison of the 14 cases with 41 controls matched for age (+/- 4 years) and cohabitation on the oncology unit, risk factors for colonisation with VRE included duration of neutropenia, (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.0-13.1), and antibiotic therapy, (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.08-15.3), the number of antibiotic agents received, (OR, 8.4; 95% CI, 1.34-34.3) and the duration of therapy with amikacin, (OR, 10.7; 95% CI, 1.4-81.5), ceftazidime, (OR, 11.5; 95% CI, 2.2 59.9) or teicoplanin, (OR, 12.3; 95% CI, 2.25-67.4).

Testosterone replacement therapy improves bone density in men with hypogonadal osteoporosis, particularly if the epiphyses are still open. There is no well-established treatment for idiopathic osteoporosis in men, but testosterone supplementation may prove to be useful. Further studies are required to confirm the safety and efficacy of this treatment in eugonadal men with osteoporosis."
True,drug condemned without attempt made determine incidence socalled delayed chloroform poisoning result drug still use chloroform controversy remains unsettled daynan,9921434,chloroform,poisoning,"Postoperative hepatic dysfunction will remain a difficult entity to place in perspective until increased data are obtained from prospective clinical trials. Ideally these data should compare hepatic dysfunction not only to other postoperative complications, both with regard to overall incidence and to mortality, but also to the overall risks of anesthesia and surgery. The contribution of drug-induced hepatic damage to postoperative hepatic dysfunction has remained unsettled since chloroform was first incriminated during the nineteenth century. The drug was condemned in 1912, without any attempt being made to determine the incidence of the so-called delayed chloroform poisoning, with the result that the drug is still in use and the chloroform controversy remains unsettled to this day. The halothane controversy is also unsettled and currently overshadows the former controversy, although academically of no greater importance. Although not an anesthetic, cincophen is another drug about which there is controversy concerning its hepatotoxic potential. Babior and Davidson noted that it was the first drug implicated in hepatic necrosis--presumably with the exception of chloroform--the first report appearing in 1922. In 1941 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association concluded that the case against cincophen was not proved and that an urgent need existed for controlled clinical studies. Twenty-five years later Babior and Davidson noted that such studies had still not been undertaken and that the situation was the same as it was a quarter of a century earlier. Perhaps the time has come for a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to be undertaken so as to evaluate the hepatotoxicity of one of these drugs. Perhaps an anesthetic agent such as halothane, concerning multiple administrations of which there is currently serious question, would be a suitable choice for such a study. The drug is in wide use today, partly because of evidence of satisfactory death rates following its administration, but also because on the basis of much excellent physiological data--but an almost total lack of any confirmatory epidemiological evidence--it is thought to contribute positively toward a low overall incidence of postoperative morbidity. Perhaps in addition, as a corollary, the time has come when, as attempts to illuminate a well--enunciated problem of this nature--that is, to test a clearly formulated hypothesis--the isolated case report, the collection of isolated case reports, the series of patients reported in the absence of a proven comparable control group, and the uncontrolled survey, should be ""laid to rest."" At best they provide only additional hypothesis-formulating information. At worst, however, they give increased exposure to a suggestion concerning cause and effect upon which physicians may act to their patients' detriment if the hypothesis ultimately proves to be erroneous. MacMahon et al. have stated that although there is no clear-cut dividing line between descriptive and analytical epidemiology, most epidemiological studies can indeed be classified primarily as either hypothesis-formulating or hypothesis-testing. Just as we have conducted the definitive retrospective hypothesis-testing study--the National Halothane Study--demanded by the ""halothane hepatitis"" controversy, so must we now move to the final stage of epidemiological investigation (experimental epidemiology) by investigating the effects of multiple administrations of the drug. On this point the National Halothane Study acts more as a hypothesis-formulating study than as a hypothesis-testing study. Hill has noted that statistical problems must be dealt with by the statistical method. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"

We aimed to develop a procedure for inducing adrenergic supersensitivity that could be used to investigate the role of catecholamines in these clinical conditions. In the first study, three doses of guanethidine were administered by iontophoresis to separate small patches of skin in the forearm of healthy human volunteers. Four to five hours later. the vasoconstrictor response to the adrenergic releasing agent tyramine was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by iontophoretic pretreatment with guanethidine, indicating that guanethidine had depleted endogenous adrenergic stores. In a second study, guanethidine and saline were administered by iontophoresis four times over approximately 2 weeks at separate sites in the forearm. One to two days after the final pretreatment, vasoconstriction to the iontophoresis of a weak dose of noradrenaline was enhanced at sites pretreated with guanethidine. To investigate the effect of guanethidine pretreatment on thermal hyperalgesia. the experimental sites were sensitized to heat by the topical application of 0.6% capsaicin. Both before and after the application of capsaicin, the heat-pain threshold and heat-pain ratings to suprathreshold stimulation were similar at sites pretreated for 2 weeks with guanethidine or saline. However, after the iontophoresis of noradrenaline, thermal hyperalgesia was greater at the guanethidine-pretreated site than the saline pretreated site. These observations indicate that prolonged depletion of adrenergic stores by guanethidine induces adrenergic supersensitivity in cutaneous vessels, and that adrenergic supersensitivity enhances thermal hyperalgesia in the presence of noradrenaline."

The case report questions the long term use of pain killers combined with psycho-active drugs in chronic non malignant pain, especially if pain is under control."
False,belgium high doses third generation cephalosporins remain effective treatment pneumococcal meningitis nan,12723258,cephalosporins,pneumococcal meningitis,"Cerebrospinal fluid isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, collected during the years 1997-2000 at more than 100 Belgian laboratories were studied. The 10 most common serotypes-serogroups representing 76% of the isolates were 14, 6, 9, 19, 23, 18, 4, 10, 8 and 12 (in order of frequency). Thirty-six percent of strains were isolated in children < 5 years old. In this age group the number of serogroups was more limited and 81.4% are included in the 7-valent conjugate vaccine. Decreased susceptibility to penicillin was observed in 13.9% of 237 strains (MIC > 0.06 mg/L), with only 2.1% resistant strains (MIC > 1 mg/L). Twelve strains showed reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime (MIC > 0.5 mg/L). Only three of the 237 strains were intermediately susceptible to meropenem. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin and moxifloxacin. In Belgium, high doses of third generation cephalosporins remain effective for the treatment of pneumococcal meningitis. The new fluoroquinolones seem the most promising agents for the treatment of pneumococcal meningitis in the future."
True, na(+) ncx expression reported increased human heart failure nan,15165985,Na(+),heart failure,"The Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) may influence cardiac function depending on its predominant mode of action, forward mode or reverse mode, during the contraction-relaxation cycle. The intracellular Na(+) concentration ([Na(+)](i)) and the duration of the action potential as well as the level of NCX protein expression regulate the mode of action of NCX. [Na(+)](i) and NCX expression have been reported to be increased in human heart failure. Nevertheless, the consequences of altered NCX expression in heart failure are still a matter of discussion. We aimed to characterize the influence of NCX expression on intracellular Ca(2+) transport in rat cardiomyocytes by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer. A five- to ninefold (dose dependent) overexpression of NCX protein was achieved after 48 h by somatic gene transfer (Ad.NCX.GFP) versus control (Ad.GFP). NCX activity, determined by Na(+) gradient-dependent (45)Ca(2+)-uptake, was significantly increased. The protein expressions of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, phospholamban, and calsequestrin were unaffected by NCX overexpression. Fractional shortening (FS) of isolated cardiomyocytes was significantly increased at low stimulation rates in Ad.NCX.GFP. After a step-wise enhancing frequency of stimulation to 3.0 Hz, FS remained unaffected in Ad.GFP cells but declined in Ad.NCX.GFP cells. The positive inotropic effect of the cardiac glycoside ouabain was less effective in Ad.NCX.GFP cells, whereas the positive inotropic effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation remained unchanged. In conclusion, NCX overexpression results in a reduced cell shortening at higher stimulation frequencies as well as after inhibition of sarcolemmal Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, i.e., in conditions with enhanced [Na(+)](i). At low stimulation rates, increased NCX expression enhances both intracellular systolic Ca(2+) and contraction amplitude."
False,estrogen progesterone receptors er pr immunocytochemically analysed mammary tumour cells obtained fine needle sampling patientsnan,11556039,Estrogen,tumour,"Eighty-eight women presenting with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were treated with tamoxifen alone. Estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) were immunocytochemically analysed in mammary tumour cells obtained by fine needle sampling from 73 patients. Of the breast carcinomas, 34.2% were ER+/PR+ and 43.8% were ER-/PR-. The ER+ content increased with age in postmenopausal women. After tamoxifen treatment objective remission occurred in 39.7% of the women. The overall response rate was 53.3% in the ER+/PR- group and 73.1% in the ER+/PR+ group. However, the response elicited in a case of the ER-/PR- phenotype justified the randomized use of tamoxifen among patients in Iraq where the necessary requirements for hormone receptor assessment are almost unavailable."
True,amiodarone effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility limited many sideeffects problematic pneumonitis pneumonitis side effect amiodarone,1595783,Amiodarone,pneumonitis,"Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side-effects, the most problematic being pneumonitis. The pulmonary toxicity of amiodarone is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and T cell-mediated hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The clinical and radiographic features of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity are characteristic but nonspecific. The diagnosis depends on exclusion of other entities, such as heart failure, infection, and malignancy. While withdrawal of amiodarone leads to clinical improvement in majority of cases, this is not always possible or advisable. Dose reduction or concomitant steroid therapy may have a role in selected patients."
False,administration exogenous ascorbic acid advocated therefore treatment systemic chromium poisoning chromium dermatitis enhance extracellular reduction chromium(vi) less bioavailable chromiumiiinan,10382555,chromium(VI),dermatitis,"Repeated topical exposure to chromium(VI) may cause an allergic contact dermatitis or the formation of chrome ulcers. Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III)."

We performed an epi-analysis of two randomized controlled trials. The participants were 313 women aged 18-42 years with PCOS who had singleton pregnancies. They were randomized to metformin or placebo treatment from first trimester until delivery. We analysed the prevalence of late miscarriage/preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes according to both the intention-to-treat principle and per protocol analysis. The metformin-treated patients had less late miscarriage/preterm delivery; five (3%) vs. 18 (11%) in the placebo group (p < 0.01). There was no difference in the prevalence of gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia between the metformin and the placebo group. In this epi-analysis, metformin treatment during pregnancy seems to reduce early delivery in women with PCOS. We believe that further randomized studies should be performed before firm conclusions can be drawn."
True,death worst outcome gi complications low dose asa users data aspect scarcenan,22542152,ASA,Death,"Low dose aspirin (ASA) use has been associated with a wide range of adverse side effects in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which range from troublesome symptoms without mucosal lesions to more serious toxicity, including ulcers, GI bleeding, perforation and even death. Upper GI symptoms in low dose ASA users are common but often careless or misinterpreted and they are not always related to the presence of mucosal injury. Usually, low dose ASA related ulcers are reasonably small and asymptomatic, and probably heal over a period of weeks to a few months. But, the real clinical problem occurs when the ulcer results in a GI complication (mostly bleeding). The estimated average excess risk of symptomatic or complicated ulcer related to low dose ASA is five cases per 1000 ASA users per year. Death is the worst outcome of GI complications in low dose ASA users, but data about this aspect are scarce. Current evidence indicates that low dose ASA can damage the lower GI tract also, but the real size of the problem is still unknown."

In our hospital, three different concentrations of ropivacaine solution (0.1%, 0.15%, 0.2%) in combination with 1 microg/mL fentanyl were available for PCEA. As some studies have reported a much higher incidence of motor block and opioid-related side effects with 0.2% ropivacaine in combination with 4 microg/mL fentanyl, it was our intent to analyze the data of our patients who had received PCEA after upper abdominal surgery. In addition to comparing the analgesic effects and the incidence of motor block and opioid-related side effects of these three different ropivacaine/fentanyl solutions, we also evaluated the workload of our pain staff. The main purpose of our study was to determine which of these three regimens of ropivacaine was most satisfactory with the least workload for the pain service staff."

Patients had tumours that failed or progressed after first-line platinum-containing regimens for advanced or metastatic disease, or had progressive disease after platinum-containing chemotherapy given with adjuvant or neoadjuvant intent. Response and adverse events were assessed according to WHO criteria and NCI-CTC (version 2), respectively. Out of 51 patients treated with 320 mg m(-2) of vinflunine, nine patients responded to the therapy yielding an overall response rate of 18% (95% CI: 8.4-30.9%), and 67% (95%CI: 52.1-79.3%) achieved disease control (PR+SD). Of note, responses were seen in patients with relatively poor prognostic factors such as a short (<12 months) interval from prior platinum therapy (19%, including an 11% response rate in those progressing <3 months after platinum treatment), prior treatment for metastatic disease (24%), prior treatment with vinca alkaloids (14%) and visceral involvement (20%). The median duration of response was 9.1 months (95% CI: 4.2-15.0) and the median PFS was 3.0 months (95% CI: 2.4-3.8). The median OS was 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.8-7.6). The main haematological toxicity was grade 3-4 neutropenia, observed in 67% of patients (42% of cycles). Febrile neutropenia was observed in five patients (10%) and among them two were fatal. Constipation was frequently observed (but was manageable and noncumulative) and was grade 3-4 in only 8% of patients. The incidence of grade 3 nausea and vomiting was very low (4 and 6% of patients, respectively). Neither grade 3-4 sensory neuropathy nor severe venous irritation was observed. Moreover, and of importance in this particular study population, no grade 3-4 renal function impairment was observed. Vinflunine is an active agent for the treatment of platinum-pretreated bladder cancer, and these results warrant further investigation in phase III trials, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents as treatment of advanced/metastatic TCC of the bladder."

False,thereby new nanosystems carbosilane dendrimers shown safe effective compounds hiv great potential topical microbicidesnan,25114528,carbosilane,HIV,"Self-administered topical microbicides or oral preexposure prophylaxis could be very helpful tools for all risk groups to decrease the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection rates. Up until now, antiretrovirals (ARVs) have been the most advanced microbicide candidates. Nevertheless, the majority of clinical trials has failed in HIV-1 patients. Nanotechnology offers suitable approaches to develop novel antiviral agents. Thereby, new nanosystems, such as carbosilane dendrimers, have been shown to be safe and effective compounds against HIV with great potential as topical microbicides. In addition, because most of the attempts to develop effective topical microbicides were unsuccessful, combinatorial strategies could be a valid approach when designing new microbicides. We evaluated various combinations of anionic carbosilane dendrimers with sulfated (G3-S16) and naphthyl sulfonated (G2-NF16) ended groups with different ARVs against HIV-1 infection. The G3-S16 and G2-NF16 dendrimers showed a synergistic or additive activity profile with zidovudine, efavirenz, and tenofovir in the majority of the combinations tested against the X4 and R5 tropic HIV-1 in cell lines, as well as in human primary cells. Therefore, the combination of ARVs and polyanionic carbosilane dendrimers enhances the antiviral potency of the individual compounds, and our findings support further clinical research on combinational approaches as potential microbicides to block the sexual transmission of HIV-1.

True,randomized study patients coronary artery bypass surgery examined whether light versus heavy sedation propofol intensive care unit associated increased degree myocardial ischemia nan,9356086,propofol,myocardial ischemia,"The influence of light versus heavy sedation after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery on the development of postoperative myocardial ischemia has not been described. After uncomplicated CABG surgery, 50 patients were randomly assigned to receive LOW (n = 24; target Ramsay Sedation Score [RSS] = 2) or HIGH (n = 26; target RSS = 4) sedation with propofol. Analgesia was provided to maintain a visual analog scale (VAS) pain score <7. Myocardial ischemia was identified perioperatively using continuous 3-lead Holter monitoring. By measuring creatine kinase (CK) MB levels preoperatively, at entry to the intensive care unit (ICU), and every 12 h for 48 h; and by obtaining serial 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) (preoperatively; 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 h after ICU admission, 8:00 AM the morning after surgery; and 5 min pre- and postextubation), myocardial infarction was identified. Endocrine stress response was assessed by measuring serum cortisol levels preoperatively, on admission to the ICU, and 24 h postoperatively. In a subset of patients (LOW n = 10, HIGH n = 11), plasma and urinary catecholamine levels were also measured. There were no between-group differences in demographics, operative course, hemodynamic variables, or cortisol levels while in the ICU. The VAS pain score and target RSS were achieved and sustained, and they differed between groups. There were three myocardial infarctions in each group by CKMB criteria alone. No ECG-identifiable myocardial infarction occurred. The ST segment versus time curve (LOW 187 +/- 295 versus HIGH 1071 +/- 2137 mm/min) differed between groups. Urinary and plasma catecholamine levels were similar between groups over the observation period. We conclude that the use of a reduced sedation regimen in combination with adequate analgesia did not result in an increased endocrine stress response or risk of myocardial ischemia."

False,anti proliferative activity elacy cp combination cloretazine vnpm idarubicin gemcitabine irinotecan topotecan human leukemia lymphoma cellsnan,18398748,gemcitabine,lymphoma,"This study evaluated combination drug partners for CP-4055, the C18:1(Delta9,trans) unsaturated fatty acid ester of cytarabine in HL-60 and U937 cells. Growth inhibition was assessed by ATP assay and drug interaction by the combination index and three dimensional methods. Synergy was observed in HL-60 cells for simultaneous combinations of CP-4055 with gemcitabine, irinotecan and topotecan, while combinations with cloretazine (VNP40101M) and idarubicin were additive. In U937 cells, synergy was observed with gemcitabine and additivity for the other drugs. In HL-60, the IC50 concentration of CP-4055 could be reduced 10-fold and that of gemcitabine 3-fold in combination versus the agents alone, an interaction that was independent of drug sequence, ratio and exposure time. In contrast, interactions of CP-4055 with the topoisomerase inhibitors became antagonistic when the drugs were administered 24 h prior to CP-4055 and at certain drug ratios, particularly in U937 cells. In summary, CP-4055 produced additive to synergistic anti proliferative activity when combined simultaneously with drugs from four mechanistic classes in cell culture models of human leukemia and lymphoma. The impact of drug sequence and ratio on the interactions argues for incorporation of these parameters into the design of combination chemotherapy regimens."
False,results suggest chloroquine may potentiate anti cancer effect 5-fu via cell cycle inhibitionnan,22716215,chloroquine,cancer,"Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that degrades cytoplasmic proteins and organelles for recycling. The role of autophagy in tumorigenesis is controversial because autophagy can be either protective or damaging to tumor cells, and its effects may change during tumor progression. A number of cancer cell lines have been exposed to chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, with the aim of inhibiting cell growth and inducing cell death. In addition, chloroquine inhibits a late phase of autophagy. This study was conducted to investigate the anti-cancer effect of autophagy inhibition, using chloroquine together with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in a colon cancer cell line. Human colon cancer DLD-1 cells were treated with 5-FU (10 μΜ) or chloroquine (100 μΜ), or a combination of both. Autophagy was evaluated by western blot analysis of microtubule-associated protein light chain3 (LC3). Proliferative activity, alterations of the cell cycle, and apoptosis were measured by MTT assays, flow cytometry, and western blotting. LC3-II protein increased after treatment with 5-FU, and chloroquine potentiated the cytotoxicity of 5-FU. MTT assays showed that 5-FU inhibited proliferation of the DLD-1 cells and that chloroquine enhanced this inhibitory effect of 5-FU. The combination of 5-FU and chloroquine induced G1 arrest, up-regulation of p27 and p53, and down-regulation of CDK2 and cyclin D1. These results suggest that chloroquine may potentiate the anti-cancer effect of 5-FU via cell cycle inhibition. Chloroquine potentiates the anti-cancer effect of 5-FU in colon cancer cells. Supplementation of conventional chemotherapy with chloroquine may provide a new cancer therapy modality."

Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III)."
True,additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness nausea ie nicotine increases sensitivity motion sickness nan,17990061,nicotine,motion sickness,"Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."
False,"concentration microm 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde caused growth inhibition human cancer cellnan",19023807,"3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde",cancer,"The CKII inhibitory compound was purified from the fruit of Xanthium strumarium by organic solvent extraction and silica gel chromatography. The inhibitory compound was identified as 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde by analysis with FT-IR, FAB-Mass, EI-Mass, (1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR. 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde inhibited the phosphotransferase activity of CKII with IC(50) of about 783 microM. Steady-state studies revealed that the inhibitor acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the substrate ATP. A value of 138.6 microM was obtained for the apparent K(i). Concentration of 300 microM 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde caused 50% growth inhibition of human cancer cell U937. 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde-induced cell death was characterised with the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and procaspase-3. Furthermore, the inhibitor induced the fragmentation of DNA into multiples of 180 bp, indicating that it triggered apoptosis. This induction of apoptosis by 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde was also confirmed by using flow cytometry analysis. Since CKII is involved in cell proliferation and oncogenesis, these results suggest that 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde may function by inhibiting oncogenic disease, at least in part, through the inhibition of CKII activity."

The low rate of sustained response of chronic hepatitis with current therapies, underscores the need for new therapeutic options. It has been suggested that thymalfasin may have efficacy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C. Pilots studies in patients with chronic hepatitis B treated with thymalfasin in combination with interferon or nucleoside analogue, showed a 70% complete sustained response rate. Studies in chronic hepatitis C patients, would indicate that thymalfasin in combination with standard or pegylated interferon with ribavirin may improve response rate in hepatitis C virus (HCV) naïve and nonresponder patients. However, a large phase-III randomized study conducted in Europe in HCV patients nonresponder to Peg-interferon with ribavirin, demonstrated that thymalfasin did not improve the rate of sustained virologic responses, but, in patients who completed therapy, thymalfasin significantly diminished the relapse rate. In conclusion, thymalfasin, in combination with the standard of care, may be helpful as an adjuvant in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B and C."

The differences in the rates of DVT and proximal DVT are statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Bleeding occurred in one patient in the treatment group (incidence 2%) and five patients in the control group (incidence 8%). This study confirms that therapy with heparin and graduated compression stockings is effective, inexpensive, and convenient for the prevention of venous thrombosis in fractured hip patients and is associated with a low bleeding risk."
False,however case lipid raft inhibitors nystatin beta mcd disrupted patchingnan,14565868,nystatin,MCD,"We examined the role of BCR cell membrane redistribution in anti-IgM-induced apoptosis in three human B cell lines, RA#1, 2G6, and MC116, that differ in their relative levels of sIgM expression. The apoptotic response was found to be dependent on the nature of the anti-IgM and the cell line. In the cell lines, RA#1 and MC116, sIgM aggregated into patches that were insensitive to the disruption of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains by nystatin or beta-MCD. The B cell line 2G6 was able to reorganize sIgM into a tight coalescent cap upon anti-IgM treatment. However, in this case, the lipid raft inhibitors nystatin and beta-MCD disrupted the patching. In 2G6 cells, BCR-mediated apoptosis was not affected by nystatin treatment, whereas it increased in beta-MCD pretreated cells. Thus, no evident correlation was found between apoptosis and BCR cell membrane redistribution or lipid raft formation in either of the three cell lines. The data indicate that the apoptotic signal transduction pathway is independent of BCR translocation into lipid rafts and/or aggregation."

In vivo these substances significantly reduced the weight of neuroblastoma tumour transplants in the mice (nude/nude) (P less than 0.05). A dose/effect relationship could be established. In vitro, the D50 was determined, using fibroblasts as controls. The growth of neuroblastoma tumours was inhibited by different mechanisms: L-dopa and its metabolite dopamine reduced the activity of tyrosinase, BSO reduced glutathione levels, and L-dopa and tamoxifen raised cAMP concentrations."

True,accumulating data development glucose intolerance adults receiving clozapine closer monitoring bodyweight fasting blood glucose imperativenan,11772153,clozapine,glucose intolerance,"Antipsychotics are frequently used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Atypical antipsychotics have come to the forefront in child psychiatry due largely to their tolerability profiles as well as their efficacy. Potential treatment options include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. A number of studies investigating the use of clozapine have been published in children; however, owing to the frequent monitoring required for agranulocytosis, the use of clozapine may be restricted to patients with treatment-refractory disease. With accumulating data on the development of glucose intolerance in adults receiving clozapine, closer monitoring of bodyweight and fasting blood glucose is imperative. Clozapine also has an increased seizure risk, therefore a baseline electroencephalogram should be performed, as well as continued vigilance for this adverse effect. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that is generally well tolerated and numerous studies have been published investigating this drug in children. Unlike clozapine, its receptor interaction profile lends itself toward increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinaemia. Bodyweight gain is a common adverse effect, although somewhat less than that reported with olanzapine. Baseline liver function studies prior to initiation of this medication are recommended. Risperidone-induced mania has been reported in adults and, therefore, increased caution should be used when deciding to treat children and adolescents with risperidone, particularly in those with a predisposition toward mania. Olanzapine, like risperidone, has also been associated with onset of mania in adults. Olanzapine has a receptor profile that results in significant risk for bodyweight gain and sedation. Furthermore, this drug has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance; thus, it is important to monitor bodyweight and fasting blood glucose on a frequent basis. Less information is known about quetiapine in children and adolescents. Reports about its efficacy and tolerability vary. Quetiapine appears to have increased risk for sedation and bodyweight gain, albeit less than that of olanzapine. The compound appears to be less likely to induce EPS. Finally, ziprasidone has recently been approved for use in the adult population. This compound, in terms of its receptor profile, has more in common with risperidone. This suggests a potential for increased risk of EPS and hyperprolactinaemia. It also has an increased risk of QTc prolongation; thus, a baseline electrocardiogram is suggested, particularly in those patients with a history of cardiovascular illness. Lack of evidence for bodyweight gain with ziprasidone is a considerable advantage."
True,serotonin syndrome venlafaxine tranylcypromine interactionnan,8888541,tranylcypromine,Serotonin syndrome,"Excessive stimulation of serotonin 5HT1A receptors causes a syndrome of serotonin excess that consists of shivering, muscle rigidity, salivation, confusion, agitation and hyperthermia. The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. We report a venlafaxine-MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23-y-old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression. He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1/2 tab of venlafaxine. Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities, tremors and rigidity. He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering, myoclonic jerks, rigidity, salivation and diaphoresis. His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light. Vital signs were: blood pressure 120/67 mm Hg, heart rate 127/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and temperature 97 F. After 180 mg of diazepam i.v. he remained tremulous with muscle rigidity and clenched jaws. He was intubated for airway protection and because of hypoventilation, and was paralyzed to control muscle rigidity. His subsequent course was remarkable for non-immune thrombocytopenia which resolved. The patient's maximal temperature was 101.2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units/L with no other evidence of rhabdomyolysis. His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward. This patient survived without sequelae due to the aggressive sedation and neuromuscular paralysis."

FTY was started 3.5 months after a two-year NZB treatment. Fifteen days later, she suffered partial repetitive seizures followed by a tonicoclonic seizure. This was associated with attention difficulties and an increased asthenia. Brain MRI follow-up disclosed large demyelinating active lesions in favour of disease reactivation. This case suggests that FTY introduction may occur less than three months after NZB withdrawal."

He had been taking VPA for treatment of idiopathic generalized tonic-clonic convulsions since he was 56 years old. After substituting VPA with zonisamide, the serum sodium level returned to normal. We consider this episode of SIADH to be the result of a combination of factors including a weakness of the central nervous system and the long-term administration of VPA."
False,role activation bradykinin receptors disruption bloodbrain barrier acute hypertension bradykinin part bradykinin receptors activated receptors disrupting bloodbrain barrier somehow,8955532,bradykinin,hypertension,"Cellular mechanisms which account for disruption the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension are not clear. The goal of this study was to determine the role of synthesis/release of bradykinin to activate B2 receptors in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier was quantitated by clearance of fluorescent-labeled dextran before and during phenylephrine-induced acute hypertension in rats treated with vehicle and Hoe-140 (0.1 microM). Phenylephrine infusion increased arterial pressure, arteriolar diameter and clearance of fluorescent dextran by a similar magnitude in both groups. These findings suggest that disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension is not related to the synthesis/release of bradykinin to activate B2 receptors."
False,aida doses microg microl diminished haloperidolinduced muscle rigidity nan,12231232,AIDA,muscle rigidity,"The aim of the present study was to find out whether the metabotropic receptor 1 (mGluR1) and group II mGluRs, localized in the striatum, are involved in antiparkinsonian-like effects in rats. Haloperidol (1 mg/kg ip) induced parkinsonian-like muscle rigidity, measured as an increased resistance of a rat's hind foot to passive flexion and extension at the ankle joint. (RS)-1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA; 0.5-15 microg/0.5 microl), a potent and selective mGluR1 antagonist, or (2R,4R)-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (2R,4R-APDC; 7.5-15 microg/0.5 microl), a selective group II agonist, was injected bilaterally into the striatum of haloperidol-treated animals. AIDA in doses of 7.5-15 microg/0.5 microl diminished the haloperidol-induced muscle rigidity. In contrast, 2R,4R-APDC injections were ineffective. The present results may suggest that the blockade of striatal mGluR1, but not the stimulation of group II mGluRs, may ameliorate parkinsonian muscle rigidity."
True,caspasedependent cell death mediates potent cytotoxicity sulfide derivatives 9-anilinoacridine nan,18454048,9-anilinoacridine,cytotoxicity,"9-anilinoacridine contains a tricyclic and planar aromatic structure that enables DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. Two recently developed sulfide derivatives of 9-anilinoacridines, 2-({4-[4-(acridin-9-ylamino)phenylthio]phenyl}(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)ethan-1-ol (CK0402) and 3-({4-[4-(acridin-9-ylamino)phenylthio]phenyl}(3-hydroxypropyl)amino)propan-1-ol (CK0403), displayed potent cytotoxic activity in multiple cancer cell lines. In-vitro enzymatic assay demonstrated that CK0402 and CK0403 directly inhibit decatenation reaction of topoisomerase IIalpha. Cells exposed to CK0403 showed DNA fragmentation, and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-2, indicating that it triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis. This was further supported by the fact that cytotoxicity of these drugs is attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of caspases with z-VAD-FMK. Studies with wild-type and p53 primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that p53 does not play a significant role in cell death process initiated by this kind of drug. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1activity moderately enhanced cytotoxic activity of sulfide 9-anilinoacridine, suggesting that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 may have a protective function against 9-anilinoacridine-induced cell death process."

True,slcob transporter involved mtx elimination polymorphisms genes pathway could also role mtx toxicity nanpolymorphisms genes pathway causes toxicity,23222202,MTX,toxicity,"Methotrexate (MTX) is an important component of therapy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Treatment with MTX often causes toxicity, which can necessitate dose reduction or treatment cessation. Interindividual differences in adverse reactions can be due to different factors, including polymorphisms in key genes. Recently, we confirmed the association between SLCO1B1 rs11045879 polymorphism and toxicity previously proposed by Treviño and colleagues. As SLCO1B1 is a transporter involved in MTX elimination, other polymorphisms in genes from this pathway could also have a role in MTX toxicity. The aim of the present study was to analyze in depth the role of polymorphisms in the genes of the MTX transport pathway as putative toxicity predictors in pediatric ALL."
True,human pentachlorophenol poisoning nan,7904464,pentachlorophenol,poisoning,"Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was, and still is, one of the most frequently used fungicides and pesticides. Its toxicity is due to interference with oxidative phosphorylation. Acute and chronic poisoning may occur by dermal absorption, inhalation or ingestion. Chronic poisoning occurs mainly in sawmill workers or people living in log homes treated with PCP-containing wood protecting formulations. Quantitative determination of PCP in urine and serum is useful to detect occupational or subclinical exposure. The clinical features of acute and chronic PCP poisoning can be classified systematically into effects on the skin, metabolism (fever), the haematopoietic tissue, the respiratory system, the central and peripheral nervous system, the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract. Although PCP is not classified as a human carcinogen, some epidemiological observations suggest that exposure to chlorophenols in general and PCP solutions in particular may result in an increased risk for certain malignant disorders such as nasal carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma. There is concern that contamination of PCP-solutions with products such as chlorodibenzo-p-dioxins is the real cause of this suspected carcinogenicity. No specific antidote exists for the treatment of (acute) PCP poisoning. The basis of the treatment of acute poisoning is intensive supportive care with prevention of dangerous rise in temperature. Use of PCP-based products as indoor wood preservatives poses an unacceptable risk to human health."
False,however preference given oral route bps started early process metastatic bone disease patient receiving hormone therapynan,12136223,BPs,bone disease,"Bisphosphonates (BPs) are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and it is well accepted that tumor cells in bone, especially breast cancer and myeloma cells, can stimulate osteoclast formation and activity leading to the release of growth factors or cytokines, which will further stimulate cancer cells' growth and their secretion of osteolytic factors. BPs are now the standard treatment for cancer hypercalcemia, for which a dose of 90 mg of pamidronate or 1500 mg of clodronate is recommended; the former compound is more potent and has a longer lasting effect. Repeated pamidronate infusions exert clinically relevant analgesic effects in more than half of patients with metastatic bone pain. Recent data suggest that non-responding patients should perhaps be treated with higher doses. The optimal dose actually remains to be defined, especially as it is thought that it is probably a function of the disease stage. Regular pamidronate infusions can also achieve a partial objective response according to conventional UICC criteria and they can almost double the objective response rate to chemotherapy. Lifelong administration of oral clodronate to patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone reduces the frequency of morbid skeletal events by more than one-fourth. Two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials comparing monthly 90 mg pamidronate infusions to placebo infusions for 1-2 years in addition to hormone or chemotherapy in patients with at least one lytic bone metastasis have shown that the mean skeletal morbidity rate could be reduced by 30-40%. The results obtained with intravenous BPs are generally viewed as better than those obtained with oral clodronate. However, preference can be given to the oral route when BPs are started early in the process of metastatic bone disease in a patient receiving hormone therapy. According to the recently published ASCO guidelines, pamidronate 90 mg i.v. delivered over 2 h every 3-4 weeks can be recommended in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have imaging evidence of lytic destruction of bone and who are concurrently receiving systemic therapy with hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Furthermore, the ASCO Panel considered it ""reasonable"" to start i.v. BPs in women with localized pain whose bone scans were abnormal and plain radiographs normal, but not when an abnormal bone scan is asymptomatic. The pertinence of these criteria is discussed below. Because BPs are providing supportive care, reducing the rate of skeletal morbidity but evidently not abolishing it, the criteria for stopping their administration have to be different from those used for classic antineoplastic drugs, and they should not be stopped when metastatic bone disease is progressing. However, criteria to determine whether and for how long an individual patient benefits from their administration are lacking. New biochemical markers of bone resorption might help identify those patients continuing to benefit from therapy. Even better results have been achieved in patients with multiple myeloma, and the general consensus is that BPs should be started as soon as the diagnosis of lytic disease is made in myeloma patients. On the other hand, data are scanty in prostate cancer, but large-scale trials with potent BPs are ongoing or planned in such patients. Similar results to those achieved with pamidronate have been obtained with monthly 6-mg infusions of the newer BP ibandronate in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone. The tolerance of ibandronate could be better, and the drug has the potential to be administered as a 15- to 30-min infusion. Zoledronate can also be administered safely as a 15-min 4-mg infusion, and large scale phase III trials have just been completed. These newer BPs will simplify the current therapeutic schemes and improve the cost-effectiveness ratio; they also have the potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy, at least in patients with an aggressive osteolytic disease or when given as adjuvant therapy. For that matter, initial data with clodronate indicate that they have the potential to prevent the development of bone metastases, but the use of BPs in the adjuvant setting must still be viewed as experimental."

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is associated with an increased risk of premature coronary heart disease. In the postprandial state, circulating lipids and lipoproteins can modulate OS status. Our aim was to study the response of lymphomonocyte OS status and reactive oxygen species by-products after an oral unsaturated fat load test (OFLT) in those with FH and to compare this response with that obtained in normolipidemic, normoglycemic subjects. We studied 12 patients with FH and 20 healthy controls. In both groups, lymphomonocyte, oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio, and malondialdehyde were determined at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after an OFLT. Fasting urinary 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine and isoprostane were measured using standard procedures. In both groups, oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio and malondialdehyde significantly decreased in the postprandial state after the OFLT. Both parameters were significantly higher in the FH group at baseline and during all the postprandial points, but the reduction from the baseline levels was significantly higher in the FH group than in the control group. Urinary 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine was significantly increased in the FH group compared with the healthy control group, indicating a higher fasting OS status. We conclude that subjects with FH exhibited OS levels that were higher than in controls before and after an OFLT, but the improvement in the OS status after the unsaturated fat load was significantly higher in subjects with FH."

False,clinical trials demonstrated efficacy safety celecoxib rofecoxib postoperative pain preemptive analgesia newer agents valdecoxib etoricoxib also demonstrated efficacy settingsnan,12204484,celecoxib,postoperative pain,"Management of acute postoperative pain remains suboptimal: nearly 80% of patients report moderate to extreme pain following surgery. New pain management paradigms incorporate multimodal analgesia, using a combination of analgesics throughout the perioperative period to control nociceptive and centrally-stimulated pain. Nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a role in postoperative pain management, but concerns about increased bleeding and inhibited wound healing and bone fusion have limited their use. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors (coxibs) offer the peripheral pain-relieving benefits of nonselective NSAIDs but with fewer adverse GI effects; they also may have a role in central sensitization. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of celecoxib and rofecoxib for postoperative pain and for preemptive analgesia, and newer agents such as valdecoxib and etoricoxib also have demonstrated efficacy in these settings. In addition to their selectivity for the COX-2 isozyme overall, unique differences among the coxibs, such as in plasma half-life, may impart certain clinical advantages."

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of exogenous catecholamines on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and beta(beta)-endorphin levels in patients with severe trauma, during the first 24 h after injury. Forty four traumatized patients with haemorrhage class III and IV were included in the study. Patients were divided in two groups: Group 1 (adrenergic, n=22) and Group 2 (non adrenergic, n=22), depending on the use of exogenous catecholamines. Blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4 and 24 h time points. Baseline values were different between the two groups, but an altered pattern of release was observed for TNFa, IL-6, IL-10 and beta-endorphin levels in patients treated with catecholamines. ICU stay was longer for the adrenergic group, while survival after 1 month was significantly lower. Findings support an altered pattern of cytokine release during the early phase after trauma, probably due to catecholamine presence."

Clonal abnormalities of chromosome 1 were reported by van den Akker. We report the cytogenetic results of 55 patients who underwent ABMT between November 1987 and July 1990: acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL, 22), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, eight), Hodgkin's disease (seven), lymphoma (16), other (two). ANLL patients received busulfan and cytoxan, and the others received cytoxan and total body irradiation as their preparative regimen before transplant. BM was purged ex vivo with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) at 30-100 micrograms/ml before reinfusion to kill tumor cells. Cytogenetic analysis was performed before and after transplant. Between one and four posttransplant specimens of BM were analyzed per patient (range 36-921 days). Chromosome abnormalities were observed in 14 of 55 patients after transplant. Seven had clonal abnormalities; all were in leukemic relapse, and one karyotype had complex rearrangements. Clonal abnormalities of chromosome 1 were not observed. Seven patients had nonclonal changes, and three of these have had overt clinical relapse. Our data suggest that clonal abnormalities observed posttransplant are best explained by clinical relapse of tumor and that ex vivo marrow purging with 4-HC is not likely to induce clonal chromosome abnormalities in normal cells. Long-term observation of these patients will be required to answer that question definitively, however."

False,potential human cancer risks exposure pcbs tale two evaluationsnan,14594106,PCBs,cancer,"In 1999 the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) released a Draft Toxicological Profile for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). In reviewing the potential human carcinogenicity of PCBs, ATSDR (1999) concluded that ""The weight of evidence does not support a causal association for PCBs and human cancer at this time."" Just 1 year later, in an updated Toxicological Profile for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), the conclusions of another analysis (ATSDR, 2000) on whether exposure to PCBs might represent a carcinogenic risk to humans had dramatically changed to ""Overall, the human studies provide some evidence that PCBs are carcinogenic"" and ""some of these studies provide meaningful evidence that PCBs are carcinogenic in humans."" Because this is a substantially different conclusion than that reached only one year previously, it raises a number of questions that must be considered particularly since ""weight of evidence"" has a precise meaning in the context of evaluating a body of epidemiological data. The present review addresses the additional scientific data that became available between the ATSDR 1999 and 2000 evaluations that was of a magnitude to offset the weight of evidence from numerous epidemiological studies that exposure to PCBs was not causally associated with human cancer to a conclusion only 1 year later that there was now ""meaningful evidence"" that PCBs posed a carcinogenic risk to humans. Also of interest are the criteria upon which this conclusion is based and the distinction between ""weight of evidence"" and the newer descriptors of ""some evidence"" and ""meaningful evidence."" However, as shown in this review, only one relevant study was published between the ATSDR 1999 and 2000 evaluations and the results of this study were unequivocally supportive of the 1999 conclusion. Because of the continuing controversy surrounding this issue, in this review, all relevant epidemiological data on PCBs are summarized and subjected to another weight of evidence evaluation. This critical review is based on the most recent guidelines (U.S. EPA, 1999a, 2003) for conducting weight-of-evidence evaluations on a body of epidemiological data. Applying a weight-of-evidence evaluation to the PCB epidemiological studies can only lead to the conclusion that there is no causal relationship between PCB exposure and any form of cancer, thereby confirming the conclusions of ATSDR (1999). Also considered is the methodology and logic used by ATSDR (2000) that resulted in overturning the weight of evidence conclusions concerning the human carcinogenicity of PCBs in ATSDR (1999). This issue may have public health and policy implications. It seems appropriate that unbiased evaluations of a body of data, even of controversial issues such as the potential human carcinogenicity of PCBs, be conducted in a transparent manner following applicable guidelines. The dramatic differences between the conclusions of ATSDR (1999) and ATSDR (2000) do not appear to be consistent with this process."
True,drinking patterns include periods alcohol consumption followed abstinence binge drinking may enhance possibility brain damage nan,8123218,alcohol,brain damage,"Alcoholism is often associated with brain damage and cognitive deficits. Because drinking patterns can include periods of alcohol consumption followed by abstinence, binge drinking may enhance the possibility of brain damage. Chronic administration of ethanol leads to upregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and calcium receptors and increased release of glucocorticoids. NMDA-mediated mechanisms and glucocorticoid actions on the hippocampus are associated with brain damage. Thus, ethanol withdrawal may make the brain more vulnerable to damage from these mechanisms, especially with binge drinking. Therapeutic adjuncts for treating ethanol withdrawal, including NMDA, calcium, and glucocorticoid antagonists, may eventually prove useful in preventing further brain damage in alcoholism."
False,multiple drug resistance pglycoprotein mdrpgp contributes drug resistance via atp dependent drug efflux pumps overexpressed many solid tumors including gastric cancer nan,24377601,ATP,gastric cancer,"Gastric cancer is one of the most frequently occurring malignancies in the world. Development of multiple drug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapy is known as the major cause of treatment failure for gastric cancer. Multiple drug resistance 1/P-glycoprotein (MDR1/p-gp) contributes to drug resistance via ATP-dependent drug efflux pumps and is overexpressed in many solid tumors including gastric cancer. To investigate the role of MDR1 knockdown on drug resistance reversal, we knocked down MDR1 expression using shRNA in drug resistant gastric cancer cells and examined the consequences with regard to adriamycin (ADR) accumulation and drug- sensitivity. Two shRNAs efficiently inhibited mRNA and protein expression of MDR1 in SGC7901-MDR1 cells. MDR1 knockdown obviously decreased the ADR accumulation in cells and increased the sensitivity to ADR treatment. Together, our results revealed a crucial role of MDR1 in drug resistance and confirmed that MDR1 knockdown could reverse this phenotype in gastric cancer cells. "

There are approximately 18,000 patients in the UK with MFS. Current treatment includes careful follow-up, beta blockers, and prophylactic surgical intervention; however, there is no known treatment which effectively prevents the rate of aortic dilatation in MFS. Preclinical, neonatal, and pediatric studies have indicated that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may reduce the rate of aortic dilatation. This trial will investigate the effects of irbesartan on aortic dilatation in Marfan syndrome."
True,corynebacterium falsenii bacteremia occurring infant vancomycin therapynan,20610679,vancomycin,Corynebacterium falsenii bacteremia,Corynebacterium falsenii was described in 1998 as a new Corynebacterium species. We give the first detailed description of a clinically significant Corynebacterium falsenii bacteremia occurring in an infant while on vancomycin therapy.
True,tacrine administered licl pretreated rats induces electrocorticographic seizures delayed hippocampal damagenan,19944736,Tacrine,seizures,"The purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound. A Tween 80-coated poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system, able to trespass the BBB. Tacrine, administered in LiCl pre-treated rats, induces electrocorticographic seizures and delayed hippocampal damage. The toxic effects of tacrine-loaded poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles (5mg/kg), a saline solution of tacrine (5mg/kg) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i.p. administration in LiCl-pre-treated Wistar rats. All the animals treated with tacrine-loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms, i.e. epileptic onset, with respect to those animals treated with the free compound (10 min vs. 22 min respectively). In addition, tacrine-loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage of neuronal cells in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals, while the saline solution of tacrine only in 60% of animals. Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control (saline-treated) group of animals. In conclusion, the evaluation of time-to-onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the tacrine-lithium model of epilepsy in the rat, could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass (or not) the BBB in vivo."

The structures of new compounds were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analyses and comparison with literature. Compounds 1-17 were examined for their inhibitory effects on Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation induced with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, a known primary screening test for inhibitors of tumor promotion. Four compounds, 1, (23E)-3β,7β-dihydroxy-25-methoxycucurbita-5,23-dien-19-al (2), karavilagenin D (11), and 12, showed potent inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction with IC(50) values in the range of 242-264 mol ratio/32 pmol TPA. In addition, compounds 1 and 11 exhibited inhibitory effects on skin-tumor promotion in an in vivo two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis test based on 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) as initiator, and with TPA as a promoter. Furthermore, upon evaluation of the cytotoxic activities of compounds 1-17 against human cancer cell lines, compounds 2, 5-7, 9, and 14 showed potent activities against HL60 cell line, and compound 2 against SK-BR-3 cell line."
True,conclusion tgfbeta might exert protective role breast cancer reducing amount active oestrogens present breastnan,10823131,oestrogens,breast cancer,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional regulator of cellular growth and differentiation in many cell types and has a growth inhibitory effect on mammary epithelial cells. The TGF-beta 2 isoform has been shown to be present in high concentrations in breast cyst fluid and might have a protective role in breast cancer. In addition, oestrogens play an important role in breast cancer development, and oestrone sulphate (E1S) might be the main source of active oestrogens in the breast. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of TGF-beta 2 on oestrogen synthesis in an attempt to understand the mechanism by which TGF-beta 2 may exert a protective effect in breast cancer. In this study, higher concentrations of TGF-beta 2 significantly inhibited the conversion of E1S to oestrone (E1) and the conversion of E1 to the potent oestrogen, oestradiol (E2). TGF-beta 2 did not have any effect on MCF-7 cell growth or on E2 to E1 conversion. In conclusion, TGF-beta 2 might exert a protective role in breast cancer by reducing the amount of active oestrogens present in the breast."
False,epothilones new class mti may associated grade peripheral neuropathy however neuropathy associated ixabepilone novel epothilone analog generally mild moderate reversible baseline grade levelsnan,18567992,epothilone B,peripheral neuropathy,"Microtubule inhibitor (MTI)-based chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer--including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones--are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone."
False,emergence linezolid resistant staphylococcus aureus prolonged treatment cystic fibrosis patients cleveland ohionan,21263048,linezolid,cystic fibrosis,"Linezolid (LZD)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LRSA) isolates were monitored from 2000 to 2009 in Cleveland, OH. LRSA first emerged in 2004 only in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, with 11 LRSA-infected CF patients being identified by 2009. LRSA was isolated from 8 of 77 CF patients with S. aureus respiratory tract infection treated with LZD from 2000 to 2006. Analysis of clinical data showed that the 8 CF patients with LRSA received more LZD courses (18.8 versus 5.9; P = 0.001) for a longer duration (546.5 versus 211.9 days; P < 0.001) and had extended periods of exposure to LZD (83.1 versus 30.1 days/year; P < 0.001) than the 69 with LZD-susceptible isolates. Five LRSA isolates included in the clinical analysis (2000 to 2006) and three collected in 2009 were available for molecular studies. Genotyping by repetitive extrapalindromic PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that seven of these eight LRSA strains from unique patients were genetically similar. By multilocus sequence typing, all LRSA isolates were included in clonal complex 5 (seven of sequence type 5 [ST5] and one of ST1788, a new single-locus variant of ST5). However, seven different variants were identified by spa typing. According to the Escherichia coli numbering system, seven LRSA isolates contained a G2576T mutation (G2603T, S. aureus numbering) in one to four of the five copies of domain V of the 23S rRNA genes. One strain also contained a mutation (C2461T, E. coli numbering) not previously reported. Two strains, including one without domain V mutations, possessed single amino acid substitutions (Gly152Asp or Gly139Arg) in the ribosomal protein L3 of the peptidyltransferase center, substitutions not previously reported in clinical isolates. Emergence of LRSA is a serious concern for CF patients who undergo prolonged courses of LZD therapy."
False,mercaptopurine mp prodrug azathioprine aza effective induction maintenance remission reduction corticosteroid exposure pediatric inflammatory bowel disease ibd nan,18266236,AZA/azathioprine,IBD/inflammatory bowel disease,6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug azathioprine (AZA) are effective for the induction and maintenance of remission and reduction of corticosteroid exposure for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The standard dose of 6-MP is 1.0-1.5 mg/kg/day and for AZA is 2.0-2.5 mg/kg/day. The aim of this study was to determine whether IBD patients 6 years of age and younger require higher than standard doses of 6-MP/AZA to achieve clinical remission.

Several saponins inhibit tumor cell growth by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis with IC50 values of up to 0.2 microM. We discuss diverse groups of saponins (dioscins, saikosaponins, julibrosides, soy saponins, ginseng saponins and avicins) investigated in relation to tumor therapy and focus on cellular and systemic mechanisms of tumor cell growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. The review also describes saponins in combination with conventional tumor treatment strategies, which result in improved therapeutic success. Some combinations of saponins and anti-tumorigenic drugs induce synergistic effects with potentiated growth inhibition."

The use of amiodarone has, however, been limited due to its serious side-effects. A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to amiodarone treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is given. It is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic injury due to amiodarone treatment, including steatosis, alterations resembling alcoholic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis of the liver. Patients receiving amiodarone should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels. Therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of cholestatic injury or hepatomegaly."
False,definition cephalosporin resistance pneumococci requires modification studies antibiotic management meningitis caused strains needed resistance cephalosporins increasing extended spectrum cephalosporins may ineffective sole therapynan,8451095,cephalosporin/cephalosporins,meningitis,"We recently managed an infant with meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in whom ceftriaxone failed to sterilize the cerebrospinal fluid after 6 days of therapy. This strain, which had a penicillin minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 micrograms/ml, appeared susceptible to ceftriaxone (MIC < 0.5 micrograms/ml) when evaluated by a commercial MIC panel (Microtech Medical Systems, Inc., Aurora, CO) but was found to have a ceftriaxone MIC of 4 micrograms/ml when evaluated by conventional microtiter broth dilution technique. Furthermore ceftriaxone therapy of meningitis induced with this strain in a rabbit model was ineffective. Thirteen of 112 pneumococcal strains (11.6%) isolated recently at Children's Medical Center of Dallas were penicillin-resistant, and 3 of these were highly penicillin-resistant (MIC > or = 2 micrograms/ml). The incidence of pneumococcal strains with cefotaxime MICs > or = 1.0 micrograms/ml has increased from 0 of 258 from 1981 to 1983 to 5 of 112 (4.5%) from 1991 to 1992. The definition of cephalosporin resistance for pneumococci requires modification and further studies of the antibiotic management of meningitis caused by such strains are needed because resistance to cephalosporins is increasing and the extended spectrum cephalosporins may be ineffective as sole therapy."

In the present study, the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose-urethane. Isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol, pindolol, labetalol and atenolol, as well as after clonidine, but not after hexamethonium or carbachol. Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with methylatropine or previously vagotomised. These results are compatible with interference by isoniazid with GABAergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone. Such interference could be exerted centrally, possibly at the nucleus ambiguus, or peripherally at the sinus node."
False,plasma cgrp concentration increased significantly migraine attack returned baseline cessation migraine cgrp part plasma cgrp concentration migraine seemed cause increase cgrp levels way around,14659530,CGRP,migraine,"The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) concentration and platelet serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine, 5-HT) content during the immediate headache and the delayed genuine migraine attack provoked by nitroglycerin. Fifteen female migraineurs (without aura) and eight controls participated in the study. Sublingual nitroglycerin (0.5 mg) was administered. Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times: 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application, and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine attack (mean 344 and 404 min; 12 subjects). In those subjects who had no migraine attack (11 subjects) a similar time schedule was used. Plasma CGRP concentration increased significantly (P<0.01) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine. In addition, both change and peak, showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity (P<0.001). However, plasma CGRP concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine attack. Basal CGRP concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5-HT content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine attack. Platelet serotonin content decreased significantly (P<0.01) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine attack. In conclusion, the fact that plasma CGRP concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between CGRP and migraine. In contrast, serotonin release from platelets does not provoke migraine, it may even counteract the headache and the concomitant CGRP release in this model."
True, patients chronic hepatitis including patients active cirrhosis child followed months mean months interferon-alpha treatmentnan,8686350,interferon-alpha,hepatitis B,"We investigated the long-term effect of interferon-alpha treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B with regard to the response status during treatment. 97 patients with chronic hepatitis B, including 18 patients with active cirrhosis Child A, were followed for 12-110 months (mean: 40.5 months) after interferon-alpha treatment. At the end of treatment complete response with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA was observed in 32 patients, partial response with loss of HBV-DNA in 30 patients and non-response with persistence of HBeAg and HBV-DNA in 35 patients. Overall, delayed virological improvement was observed in 43% of the 97 patients during follow-up. Delayed clearance of HBsAg occurred more frequently in complete responders (25%) than in partial responders (13%, P = n. s.) and non-responders (3% p = 0.0217). 39% of the partial and non-responders lost HBeAg during the follow-up period. HBsAg and HBeAg clearance rates were increased in female patients compared to males (HBsAg: 21% vs. 12%, p = n. s.; HBeAg: 47% vs. 32%, p = 0.0045). Reactivation of the disease was seen in 28% of the complete responders. In the 18 patients with active cirrhosis, short- and long-term response rates were impaired. Only, 4/18 patients had a complete response during treatment and two of these patients suffered reactivation during follow-up. One patient underwent liver transplantation and five patients died due to complications of cirrhosis. Thus, in patients without apparent cirrhosis interferon-alpha treatment has a considerable long-term effect with regard to the enhanced rate of HBsAg and HBeAg clearance during prolonged follow-up."

False,model built natural hypotheses without treatment tumor growth follows gompertz model endothelial cells sensitive temozolomide cancer cells antiangiogenic effect blocks tumor growth endothelial cells genetically stable cancer cells thus less likely develop resistance temozolomide nan,23389760,temozolomide,blocks tumor,"We propose a mathematical model that takes into account a classical maximum tolerated dose (MTD) chemotherapy regimen (whose primary targets are the tumor cells) as well as a metronomic chemotherapy regimen (whose primary targets are the tumor endothelial cells) for the administration of temozolomide (Temodal(®)) in order to compare the effectiveness of these two types of protocols. The model is built from 4 natural hypotheses: (H1) without treatment the tumor growth follows a Gompertz model, (H2) endothelial cells are more sensitive to temozolomide than cancer cells, (H3) the anti-angiogenic effect blocks tumor growth, and (H4) endothelial cells are more genetically stable than cancer cells and thus less likely to develop resistance to temozolomide. Then, we compared a conventional MTD regimen of 200 mg/m(2) temozolomide J1-J5 every 28 days with a daily metronomic regimen of 85 mg/m(2)/day for cycles of 42 days. Our mathematical model shows that the metronomic regimen induces tumor regression through anti-angiogenic effects while the MTD regimen fails to do so, due to the emergence of temozolomide resistance in cancer cells. Overall, our model is consistent with clinical observations and provides an interesting tool toward the personalization of anticancer treatments, through optimization of dose and schedule of chemotherapy based on individual patient characteristics."
False,thus atorvastatin prevented reversed dexamethasoneinduced hypertension ratnan,16820346,atorvastatin,hypertension,"To assess the antioxidant effects of atorvastatin (atorva) on dexamethasone (dex)-induced hypertension, 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with atorva 30 mg/kg/day or tap water for 15 days. Dex increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 109 +/- 1.8 to 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg and plasma superoxide (5711 +/- 284.9 saline, 7931 +/- 392.8 U/ml dex, P < 0.001). In this prevention study, SBP in the atorva + dex group was increased from 115 +/- 0.4 to 124 +/- 1.5 mmHg, but this was significantly lower than in the dex-only group (P' < 0.05). Atorva reversed dex-induced hypertension (129 +/- 0.6 mmHg, vs. 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg P' < 0.05) and decreased plasma superoxide (7931 +/- 392.8 dex, 1187 +/- 441.2 atorva + dex, P < 0.0001). Plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) was decreased in dex-treated rats compared to saline-treated rats (11.2 +/- 1.08 microm, 15.3 +/- 1.17 microm, respectively, P < 0.05). Atorva affected neither plasma NOx nor thymus weight. Thus, atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat."

We conducted a pilot, double-blind, randomized, multicenter clinical trial to study for the first time safety and efficacy of simvastatin in the acute phase of ischemic stroke. Simvastatin/placebo was given at 3-12 h from symptom onset to 60 patients with cortical strokes. Efficacy on the evolution of several inflammation markers [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, C-reactive protein, sApo/Fas, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, E-selectin, L-selectin and nitrites+nitrates] and neurological outcome was evaluated at baseline, day 1, 3, 5, 7 and 90. No differences were found amongst the biomarkers studied regarding treatment allocation. Although simvastatin patients improved significantly by the third day (46.4% vs. 17.9%, P = 0.022), a non-significant increase in mortality and greater proportion of infections (odds ratio 2.4, confidence interval 1.06-5.4) in the simvastatin group were the main safety concerns. Therefore, a larger clinical trial is needed to confirm the net benefit of this therapeutic approach."

Acetaminophen-poisoned cats develop methemoglobinemia and sometimes hepatic failure. To determine the benefit of using methylene blue, a treatment for methemoglobinemia, along with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the recommended treatment for acetaminophen-poisoned cats, groups of 3 male and 3 female cats each were given methylene blue NAC, or both after administration of acetaminophen (120 mg/kg of body weight, PO). Male cats seemed more susceptible than female cats to acetaminophen toxicosis, because 3 males died of hepatic failure (2 cats given acetaminophen/methylene blue and 1 given acetaminophen/NAC/methylene blue). Although NAC alone seemed to elicit the best overall response, methylene blue, alone or in combination with NAC, may be useful in female cats."

True,two cases delapril group withdrawn study intolerable cough one case manidipine group intolerable dizziness headache nan,11336083,manidipine,headache,"This study was designed to investigate the effect of delapril, an ACE inhibitor, and manidipine, a long action calcium antagonist, on persistent microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients. Sixty type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to take delapril 30 mg/day or manidipine 10 mg/day for 48 weeks, in an open label design. Twenty eight of thirty subjects in the delapril group and twenty nine of thirty in the manidipine group completed the study. Urine albumin excretion as measured by the urinary albumin creatinine ratio decreased significantly in both groups (112.0+/-60.9 to 95.3+/-64.9 mg/g and 108.5+/-51.0 to 96.4+/-53.5 mg/g in the delapril and manidipine group respectively, p < 0.05, by paired t-test). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly changed after treatment in the delapril group but significantly decreased in the manidipine group (130.9+/-7.1/80.2+/-6.1 to 127.2+/-7.1/78.0+/-5.3 mm/Hg, p < 0.05, by student's paired t-test). After 48 weeks of treatment, two patients in the delapril group and one patient in the manidipine group converted to normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) and one patient in each group progressed to overt nephropathy (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g). There were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, serum fructosamine, creatinine, potassium and lipid profiles after 48 weeks of treatment in both groups. Two cases in the delapril group were withdrawn during the study because of an intolerable cough and one case in the manidipine group because of intolerable dizziness and headache. In conclusion, both delapril and manidipine are effective in the reduction of microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria."

Prompted by a case of clozapine-related pericarditis in an adolescent, we undertook a retrospective chart review to discover whether any unrecognized cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy were among the children, adolescents, and young adults we had treated with clozapine. The sample comprised a total of 36 patients, who were monitored regularly over a period ranging from 2.5 to 79 months. The average observation period was 7.5 months. Patients were assessed for potential indicators of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. In more than 66% of all patients, at least one of several parameters potentially indicative of pericarditis, myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy was abnormal in at least one instance during the observation period. In all cases in which abnormalities were discovered, the abnormalities were found to be unspecific for myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. With the exception of the case which prompted our study, none of the patients were found to have developed any such disorder in the course of further treatment with clozapine."

The combination was given at the maximum tolerated dose as defined in a prior CALGB study. Of 76 eligible patients with follow-up data, complete responses were achieved in three patients (4%) and partial responses, in five patients (7%). One patient (1%) with evaluable disease showed improvement. There was only one partial response in the PS 2 patients. Performance status was a predictive factor for response or improvement (p = 0.0368). A high incidence (74%) of severe or life-threatening hematologic toxicity and fatal sepsis in four patients was a reflection of the intensity of the chemotherapeutic regime. The median survival from study entry was 7.4 months. Thirty-seven percent of the patients survived beyond 1 year; the median survival for the PS 0-1 patients was 11.7 months for the PS 2 patients, 4.1 months. Median time to treatment failure was 3.9 months, but treatment had not failed in 9% of the patients after 1 year, all of whom were PS 0-1 at time of study entry. Although the response rate with this dose-intensive chemotherapy regimen was disappointing, the median survival of PS 0-1 patients was equivalent to that of Stage III NSCLC patients in prior CALGB studies. In patients with NSCLC who are treated with chemotherapy, PS may be as important a prognostic factor as stage, when median survival is used as an endpoint."

Mood elevation and anxiety reduction based on half-hourly patient rating and a corresponding increase in tapping speed occurred with active drug infusion but not placebo infusion. The effects were dose related. The higher-dose infusion rate produced more rapid onset, greater magnitude, and longer duration of response. We conclude that mood and anxiety fluctuations related to levodopa dosing are robust pharmacologic, and not placebo, effects."

True,assessed whether early dstrain analysis could predict later anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity nan,24862616,anthracycline,cardiotoxicity,"Anthracyclines are important anticancer drugs, but their use is limited by acute and chronic cardiotoxicity. Current approaches to surveillance are often inadequate to detect myocardial disease. Strain imaging might detect earlier myocardial dysfunction. Speckle analysis of three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography improves information about left ventricular (LV) segmental and global deformation by avoiding the loss of speckles seen in monoplane bidimensional-strain analysis. We assessed whether early 3D-strain analysis could predict later anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity."
True,randomised clinical trials observational studies shown increased risk myocardial infarction stroke hypertension heart failure treatment cyclooxygenase inhibitors nan,16586083,cyclooxygenase inhibitors,myocardial infarction,"Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with concomitant risk factors. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal, vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time. A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance-specific differences, which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin-independent effects. Diagnostic markers such as N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or high-sensitive C-reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity."

False,cocarcinogenic effect retinyl acetate forestomach carcinogenesis male rats induced butylated hydroxyanisolenan,3131282,retinyl acetate,forestomach carcinogenesis,"The potential modifying effect of retinyl acetate (RA) on butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)-induced rat forestomach tumorigenesis was examined. Male F344 rats, 5 weeks of age, were maintained on diet containing 1% or 2% BHA by weight and simultaneously on drinking water supplemented with RA at various concentrations (w/v) for 52 weeks. In groups given 2% BHA, although marked hyperplastic changes of the forestomach epithelium were observed in all animals, co-administration of 0.25% RA significantly (P less than 0.05) increased the incidence of forestomach tumors (squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma) to 60% (9/15, 2 rats with carcinoma) from 15% (3/20, one rat with carcinoma) in the group given RA-free water. In rats given 1% BHA, RA co-administered at a dose of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.25% showed a dose-dependent enhancing effect on the development of the BHA-induced epithelial hyperplasia. Tumors, all papillomas, were induced in 3 rats (17%) with 0.25% RA and in one rat (10%) with 0.05% RA co-administration. RA alone did not induce hyperplastic changes in the forestomach. These findings indicate that RA acted as a co-carcinogen in the BHA forestomach carcinogenesis of the rat."
True,clozapine also increased seizure risk therefore baseline electroencephalogram performed well continued vigilance adverse effectnan,11772153,Clozapine,seizure,"Antipsychotics are frequently used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Atypical antipsychotics have come to the forefront in child psychiatry due largely to their tolerability profiles as well as their efficacy. Potential treatment options include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. A number of studies investigating the use of clozapine have been published in children; however, owing to the frequent monitoring required for agranulocytosis, the use of clozapine may be restricted to patients with treatment-refractory disease. With accumulating data on the development of glucose intolerance in adults receiving clozapine, closer monitoring of bodyweight and fasting blood glucose is imperative. Clozapine also has an increased seizure risk, therefore a baseline electroencephalogram should be performed, as well as continued vigilance for this adverse effect. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that is generally well tolerated and numerous studies have been published investigating this drug in children. Unlike clozapine, its receptor interaction profile lends itself toward increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinaemia. Bodyweight gain is a common adverse effect, although somewhat less than that reported with olanzapine. Baseline liver function studies prior to initiation of this medication are recommended. Risperidone-induced mania has been reported in adults and, therefore, increased caution should be used when deciding to treat children and adolescents with risperidone, particularly in those with a predisposition toward mania. Olanzapine, like risperidone, has also been associated with onset of mania in adults. Olanzapine has a receptor profile that results in significant risk for bodyweight gain and sedation. Furthermore, this drug has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance; thus, it is important to monitor bodyweight and fasting blood glucose on a frequent basis. Less information is known about quetiapine in children and adolescents. Reports about its efficacy and tolerability vary. Quetiapine appears to have increased risk for sedation and bodyweight gain, albeit less than that of olanzapine. The compound appears to be less likely to induce EPS. Finally, ziprasidone has recently been approved for use in the adult population. This compound, in terms of its receptor profile, has more in common with risperidone. This suggests a potential for increased risk of EPS and hyperprolactinaemia. It also has an increased risk of QTc prolongation; thus, a baseline electrocardiogram is suggested, particularly in those patients with a history of cardiovascular illness. Lack of evidence for bodyweight gain with ziprasidone is a considerable advantage."

True,addition muscle damage severe damage also seen harderian glands especially exposure mepivacaine lidocaine plus epinephrinenan,4038130,lidocaine,muscle damage,"Local anesthetics that are commonly used in ophthalmic surgery (0.75% bupivacaine hydrochloride, 2.0% mepivacaine hydrochloride, and 2.0% lidocaine hydrochloride plus 1:100,000 epinephrine) were injected into the retrobulbar area of rat eyes. Controls were injected with physiological saline. All three anesthetics produced massive degeneration of the extraocular muscles. Muscle degeneration is followed by regeneration of the damaged muscle fibers. In addition to muscle damage, severe damage was also seen in harderian glands, especially after exposure to mepivacaine and lidocaine plus epinephrine. With these findings in rats, it is hypothesized that the temporary diplopia sometimes seen in patients after ophthalmic surgery might be due to anesthetic-induced damage to the extraocular muscles."

True,supersensitivity noradrenaline contributes certain vascular disorders eg hypertension chronic neuropathic pain conditions eg complex regional pain syndrome nan,11474550,noradrenaline,regional pain syndrome/neuropathic pain,"Supersensitivity to noradrenaline contributes to certain vascular disorders (e.g., hypertension) and chronic neuropathic pain conditions (e.g., complex regional pain syndrome). We aimed to develop a procedure for inducing adrenergic supersensitivity that could be used to investigate the role of catecholamines in these clinical conditions. In the first study, three doses of guanethidine were administered by iontophoresis to separate small patches of skin in the forearm of healthy human volunteers. Four to five hours later. the vasoconstrictor response to the adrenergic releasing agent tyramine was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by iontophoretic pretreatment with guanethidine, indicating that guanethidine had depleted endogenous adrenergic stores. In a second study, guanethidine and saline were administered by iontophoresis four times over approximately 2 weeks at separate sites in the forearm. One to two days after the final pretreatment, vasoconstriction to the iontophoresis of a weak dose of noradrenaline was enhanced at sites pretreated with guanethidine. To investigate the effect of guanethidine pretreatment on thermal hyperalgesia. the experimental sites were sensitized to heat by the topical application of 0.6% capsaicin. Both before and after the application of capsaicin, the heat-pain threshold and heat-pain ratings to suprathreshold stimulation were similar at sites pretreated for 2 weeks with guanethidine or saline. However, after the iontophoresis of noradrenaline, thermal hyperalgesia was greater at the guanethidine-pretreated site than the saline pretreated site. These observations indicate that prolonged depletion of adrenergic stores by guanethidine induces adrenergic supersensitivity in cutaneous vessels, and that adrenergic supersensitivity enhances thermal hyperalgesia in the presence of noradrenaline."

False,role tyrosine kinaseindependent phosphorylation egfr activating mutation cisplatin treated lung cancer cellsnan,25701783,cisplatin,lung cancer,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is one of the hallmarks of cancer progression and resistance to anticancer therapies, particularly non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). In contrast to the canonical EGFR activation in which tyrosine residues are engaged, we have demonstrated that the non-canonical pathway is triggered by phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues through p38 and ERK MAPKs, respectively. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of non-canonical EGFR pathway in resistance mechanism against cisplatin treatment. Wild type and mutated (exon 19 deletion) EGFR-expressing cells responded similarly to cisplatin by showing MAPK-mediated EGFR phosphorylation. It is interesting that internalization mechanism of EGFR was switched from tyrosine kinase-dependent to p38-dependent fashions, which is involved in a survival pathway that counteracts cisplatin treatment. We therefore introduce a potential combinatorial therapy composed of p38 inhibition and cisplatin to block the activation of EGFR, therefore inducing cancer cell death and apoptosis. "

True,chronic carbamazepine inhibits development local anesthetic seizures kindled cocaine lidocaine nan,2790457,lidocaine,seizures,"The effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) treatment on local anesthetic-kindled seizures and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of CBZ administration. Chronic oral CBZ inhibited the development of both lidocaine- and cocaine-induced seizures, but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic seizures. Chronic CBZ also decreased the incidence of seizure-related mortality in the cocaine-injected rats. Acute CBZ over a range of doses (15-50 mg/kg) had no effect on completed lidocaine-kindled or acute cocaine-induced seizures. Repeated i.p. injection of CBZ (15 mg/kg) also was without effect on the development of lidocaine- or cocaine-kindled seizures. The differential effects of CBZ depending upon stage of seizure development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic-kindled seizures. The effectiveness of chronic but not repeated, intermittent injections of CBZ suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment regimens. The possible utility of chronic CBZ in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human cocaine users is suggested by these data, but remains to be directly evaluated."
False,terazosin maintained antihypertensive efficacy well tolerated patients variety concomitant diseases including congestive heart failure peripheral vascular disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease benign prostatic hyperplasia diabetes obesitynan,7923316,Terazosin,congestive heart failure,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the alpha 1-blocking agent terazosin on blood pressure (BP) and blood lipids in a large, variant population of patients with hypertension. A total of 16,917 patients with hypertension were evaluated at 2214 primary and community care facilities; 7808 of these patients had not been treated previously for hypertension; 3928 were switched to terazosin from another antihypertensive agent; and 5181 received terazosin in addition to an agent that had not controlled their hypertension. Terazosin produced highly significant reductions in systolic (-18.2 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) and diastolic (-13.2 +/- 0.1 mm Hg) BP when used as monotherapy (mean dose, 3.1 mg; range, 2 to 10 mg) without causing a significant increase in heart rate. Equal antihypertensive efficacy was demonstrated in men, women, blacks, and whites of all ages, with particular benefit to elderly patients (> or = 65 years of age) with systolic hypertension. Comparative studies indicated that terazosin had equal antihypertensive efficacy in combination with diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Patients who had not responded to monotherapy with one of these classes of antihypertensive drugs showed significant reductions of BP after terazosin, in the following average doses, was added to diuretics, 3.1 mg; beta-blockers, 3.4 mg; calcium channel blockers, 3.3 mg; and ACE inhibitors, 3.4 mg. Terazosin produced highly significant reductions in blood levels of total cholesterol (-5.0%), triglycerides (-6.1%), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-7.6%) without change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy. Similar favorable effects on blood lipid levels were demonstrated when terazosin was used in combination with all other classes of antihypertensive drugs. The greatest reductions in blood cholesterol (-9.2%) were observed among patients with hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol > or = 240 mg/dL). Terazosin maintained its antihypertensive efficacy and was well tolerated by patients with a variety of concomitant diseases, including congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes, and obesity. Adverse effects occurred in 17.9% of patients and caused 2.2% to drop out of the study. The most frequent adverse effects were dizziness (4.8%), headache (2.5%), and asthenia (2.4%). Only 0.4% suffered syncope and 0.2% impotence. These data demonstrate the usefulness of terazosin as monotherapy or add-on therapy for treatment of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

True,endogenous release 12(s)-hete shete host organ may affect metastatic potential melanoma nan,23664097,12(S)-HETE,melanoma,"12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) is a non-haeme iron-containing dioxygenase that forms 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) or 15(S)-HETE. Several biological mediators including cytokines, growth factors and lipid metabolites released during tumour cell-endothelial cell adhesion are associated with malignant tumour progression. Here we found that HETEs released from the host organ played a critical role in tumour metastasis. Intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma cells caused lung nodule formation, which was markedly attenuated in 12/15-LOX null mice. Co-injection of melanoma cells with 12(S)-HETE increased the lung homing activity of B16F10 melanoma cells. In vitro studies showed that 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent increase of adhesion of B16F10 cells on collagen or fibronectin. The melanoma cell adhesion was then evaluated in pulmonary primary cell culture isolated from wild-type (WT) and 12/15-LOX knockout (KO) mice. It was found that the adhesion of melanoma cells on the epithelial cells isolated from 12/15-LOX null mice was reduced in comparison with those isolated from WT mice. Treatment of 12(S)-HETE increased the pFAK in melanoma cells adhering on collagen-coated slide. The enhancement of adherence elicited by 12(S)-HETE in B16F10 cells could be antagonised by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor 14 (FAK inhibitor) or PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor). 12(S)-HETE increased the phosphorylation of FAK and ERK in adhering melanoma cells. The FAK phosphorylation induced by 12(S)-HETE was further inhibited by PD98059, indicating that FAK is the downstream target of ERK. The adhesion and lung metastasis of human melanoma cells of C32 in NOD/SCID mice were also potentiated by co-treatment with 12(S)-HETE. These results demonstrate that 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE activates ERK and FAK signalling pathways, thereby upregulates the adhesion and metastatic potential of melanoma cells. The endogenous release of 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE in the host organ may affect the metastatic potential of melanoma. "
True,conclusion mitochondrial toxicity early common event paclitaxel cisplatin induced neurotoxicitysentence follows chemicalinduced disease causes highlighted disease structure therefore correct answer cisplatininduced neurotoxicity causes mitochondrial toxicity,18809400,cisplatin,mitochondrial toxicity,"The study investigates if alpha-lipoic acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity, if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in toxic neurodegenerative cascade, and if neuroprotective effects of alpha-lipoic acid depend on mitochondria protection. We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin, two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs. This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha-lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha-lipoic acid. Our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons. Alpha-lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons: it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein with anti-oxidant and chaperone properties. In conclusion mitochondrial toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity. Alpha-lipoic acid protects sensory neurons through its anti-oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions, possibly inducing the expression of frataxin. These findings suggest that alpha-lipoic acid might reduce the risk of developing peripheral nerve toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials."
True,reserpine also produced tremor catalepsy signs suggestive parkinson's diseasenan,11999899,Reserpine,tremor,"The effects of dizocilpine (MK-801), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, were studied on dopamine-related behaviors induced by reserpine treatments. This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for Parkinson's disease, or tardive dyskinesia, and its response after glutamatergic blockage. Reserpine (1 mg/kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia, tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia. Reserpine also produced tremor and catalepsy, which are signs suggestive of Parkinson's disease. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by reserpine. However, MK-801 injection produced a significant increase of tremor in reserpine-treated mice. Reserpine (1 mg/kg), administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection (0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before the test, did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice. On the other hand, reserpine induced increases in tremor and catalepsy compared to control mice. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) administration attenuated the catalepsy and tremor induced by reserpine. Pretreatment with reserpine (1 mg/kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in tremor and catalepsy, whereas MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of reserpine. These results show that reserpine produces different and abnormal movements, which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as parkinsonian-like and tardive dsykinesia signs. The glutamatergic blockage produced by NMDA can restore these signs, such as vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions, catalepsy and tremor according to the employed model."

False,since hyperlipidemia improved pravastatin atorvastatin niceritrol since levels thyroidstimulating hormone tsh free iuml ngdl respectively patient diagnosed secondary hyperlipidemia hypothyroidismnan,17001111,niceritrol,hyperlipidemia,"The patient was a 51-year-old Japanese female who had been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. At the first medical examination, her serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) were 482 and 205 mg/dl, respectively. Since hyperlipidemia was not improved by pravastatin, atorvastatin or niceritrol, and since the levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 were 730 IU/ml and 0.3 ng/dl, respectively, the patient was diagnosed as secondary hyperlipidemia with hypothyroidism. A method for the charge isolation of lipoproteins using capillary isotachophoresis (cITP) is proposed as a clinical application because it allows us to quantitatively measure electronegative low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a potent marker of coronary heart disease. After 5 months of treatment with levothyroxine, Serum TC and LDL-C levels drastically decreased without statin treatment and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased. In the lipoprotein profiles as assessed by cITP after treatment with levothyroxin, all HDL-C subfractions were increased and fast-migrating LDL/electronegative LDL appeared to be greatly reduced after treatment, while the area under the non-modified LDL peak was increased. The cITP analysis was able to obtain more information about coronary risk factors and may be clinically useful for evaluating the effect of treatment with levothyroxine in patients with hypothyroidism and secondary hyperlipidemia."

False,conclusion results suggest angiotensin iconverting enzyme inhibitor perindopril superior calcium channel blocker amlodipine reducing vascular endothelial dysfunction coadministered angiotensin receptor blockers patients essential hypertension nan,18971536,calcium,hypertension,"The combination of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers has been shown to be more effective than the individual drugs alone in the treatment of chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine or the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on vascular endothelial function and arteriosclerosis in patients with essential hypertension who had already been receiving angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy. Thirty-two patients with essential hypertension treated with angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy were randomized to receive 5 mg of amlodipine (n=16) or 4 mg of perindopril (n=16) once daily in the morning for 24 weeks. The patients were evaluated before and after therapy to assess changes in blood pressure, flow-mediated vasodilation (a parameter of vascular endothelial function), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (a parameter of arteriosclerosis). Before treatment, there were no significant differences in the above parameters between groups. After treatment, there was a similar significant decrease in blood pressure in both groups. Flow-mediated vasodilation increased significantly in the perindopril group compared with the amlodipine group; however, the decrease in brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was not significantly different between groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril is superior to the calcium channel blocker amlodipine for reducing vascular endothelial dysfunction when co-administered with angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with essential hypertension."
False,established hifalpha knockdown gastric cancer cell lines order clarify role hifalpha chemoresistance 5-fu nan,20020496,5-FU,gastric cancer,"Among several chemotherapeutic agents, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been widely used as a key drug in adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer. However, no reliable marker, which predicts the response to 5-FU in an adjuvant setting, has been identified. Hypoxia-induced drug resistance, via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, is a major obstacle in the development of effective cancer therapy. However, few clinical studies have so far assessed the relationship between the HIF-1alpha expression and the chemo-resistance of gastric cancer patients in an adjuvant setting. We established 2 HIF-1alpha knockdown gastric cancer cell lines in order to clarify the role of HIF-1alpha in chemo-resistance against 5-FU. Furthermore, expression of HIF-1alpha was immunohistochemically assessed in 91 resected specimens. Sixty-four of 91 patients received 5-FU adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. HIF-1alpha expression was associated with the significantly shorter relapse-free survival and disease-specific survival in the 64 patients of adjuvant group (p = 0.026, 0.014, respectively), but not in the 27 of surgery group. Multivariate analysis showed that HIF-1alpha was an independent risk factor for relapse in 64 patients in the adjuvant group (p = 0.029). In conclusion, the current study confirmed, for the first time that HIF-1alpha expression is an independent risk factor for relapse in high-risk gastric cancer patients who underwent curative surgery followed by adjuvant 5-FU chemotherapy. A favorable effect of 5-FU might therefore be expected in patients that do not express HIF-1alpha, whereas, other types of chemotherapy or additional treatments, such as HIF-1alpha inhibitors, should be considered in patients that do express HIF-1alpha."

Prompted by a case of clozapine-related pericarditis in an adolescent, we undertook a retrospective chart review to discover whether any unrecognized cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy were among the children, adolescents, and young adults we had treated with clozapine. The sample comprised a total of 36 patients, who were monitored regularly over a period ranging from 2.5 to 79 months. The average observation period was 7.5 months. Patients were assessed for potential indicators of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. In more than 66% of all patients, at least one of several parameters potentially indicative of pericarditis, myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy was abnormal in at least one instance during the observation period. In all cases in which abnormalities were discovered, the abnormalities were found to be unspecific for myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. With the exception of the case which prompted our study, none of the patients were found to have developed any such disorder in the course of further treatment with clozapine."
True,lcii protein increased treatment fu chloroquine potentiated cytotoxicity funan,22716215,chloroquine,cytotoxicity,"Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that degrades cytoplasmic proteins and organelles for recycling. The role of autophagy in tumorigenesis is controversial because autophagy can be either protective or damaging to tumor cells, and its effects may change during tumor progression. A number of cancer cell lines have been exposed to chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, with the aim of inhibiting cell growth and inducing cell death. In addition, chloroquine inhibits a late phase of autophagy. This study was conducted to investigate the anti-cancer effect of autophagy inhibition, using chloroquine together with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in a colon cancer cell line. Human colon cancer DLD-1 cells were treated with 5-FU (10 μΜ) or chloroquine (100 μΜ), or a combination of both. Autophagy was evaluated by western blot analysis of microtubule-associated protein light chain3 (LC3). Proliferative activity, alterations of the cell cycle, and apoptosis were measured by MTT assays, flow cytometry, and western blotting. LC3-II protein increased after treatment with 5-FU, and chloroquine potentiated the cytotoxicity of 5-FU. MTT assays showed that 5-FU inhibited proliferation of the DLD-1 cells and that chloroquine enhanced this inhibitory effect of 5-FU. The combination of 5-FU and chloroquine induced G1 arrest, up-regulation of p27 and p53, and down-regulation of CDK2 and cyclin D1. These results suggest that chloroquine may potentiate the anti-cancer effect of 5-FU via cell cycle inhibition. Chloroquine potentiates the anti-cancer effect of 5-FU in colon cancer cells. Supplementation of conventional chemotherapy with chloroquine may provide a new cancer therapy modality."
True,two cases delapril group withdrawn study intolerable cough one case manidipine group intolerable dizziness headachenan,11336083,manidipine,dizziness,"This study was designed to investigate the effect of delapril, an ACE inhibitor, and manidipine, a long action calcium antagonist, on persistent microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients. Sixty type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to take delapril 30 mg/day or manidipine 10 mg/day for 48 weeks, in an open label design. Twenty eight of thirty subjects in the delapril group and twenty nine of thirty in the manidipine group completed the study. Urine albumin excretion as measured by the urinary albumin creatinine ratio decreased significantly in both groups (112.0+/-60.9 to 95.3+/-64.9 mg/g and 108.5+/-51.0 to 96.4+/-53.5 mg/g in the delapril and manidipine group respectively, p < 0.05, by paired t-test). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly changed after treatment in the delapril group but significantly decreased in the manidipine group (130.9+/-7.1/80.2+/-6.1 to 127.2+/-7.1/78.0+/-5.3 mm/Hg, p < 0.05, by student's paired t-test). After 48 weeks of treatment, two patients in the delapril group and one patient in the manidipine group converted to normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) and one patient in each group progressed to overt nephropathy (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g). There were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, serum fructosamine, creatinine, potassium and lipid profiles after 48 weeks of treatment in both groups. Two cases in the delapril group were withdrawn during the study because of an intolerable cough and one case in the manidipine group because of intolerable dizziness and headache. In conclusion, both delapril and manidipine are effective in the reduction of microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria."
True,chronic poisoning occurs mainly sawmill workers people living log homes treated pcp containing wood protecting formulationsnan,7904464,PCP,Chronic poisoning,"Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was, and still is, one of the most frequently used fungicides and pesticides. Its toxicity is due to interference with oxidative phosphorylation. Acute and chronic poisoning may occur by dermal absorption, inhalation or ingestion. Chronic poisoning occurs mainly in sawmill workers or people living in log homes treated with PCP-containing wood protecting formulations. Quantitative determination of PCP in urine and serum is useful to detect occupational or subclinical exposure. The clinical features of acute and chronic PCP poisoning can be classified systematically into effects on the skin, metabolism (fever), the haematopoietic tissue, the respiratory system, the central and peripheral nervous system, the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract. Although PCP is not classified as a human carcinogen, some epidemiological observations suggest that exposure to chlorophenols in general and PCP solutions in particular may result in an increased risk for certain malignant disorders such as nasal carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma. There is concern that contamination of PCP-solutions with products such as chlorodibenzo-p-dioxins is the real cause of this suspected carcinogenicity. No specific antidote exists for the treatment of (acute) PCP poisoning. The basis of the treatment of acute poisoning is intensive supportive care with prevention of dangerous rise in temperature. Use of PCP-based products as indoor wood preservatives poses an unacceptable risk to human health."

True,findings consistent increased incidence gallbladder disease related highprogesterone states suggest mpa may causative agent cholelithiasis nan,1385654,MPA,cholelithiasis,"Five out of forty-five adult men, 50 years of age or less, who had received, for at least six months, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, Depo Provera) IM, 200-400 mg/week, for prevention of sex-offending or genital-mutilating behavior developed symptomatic cholelithiasis. Thirty of these men were studied with gallbladder ultrasound prospectively off MPA and at six-month intervals while taking the medication and then six months off MPA. Gallstones recovered from two patients were found to have very high cholesterol content, suggesting they were formed in cholesterol supersaturated bile. These findings are consistent with the increased incidence of gallbladder disease related to high-progesterone states and suggest that MPA may be a causative agent in cholelithiasis. The physiologic studies on gallbladder contraction and cholecystokinin release in a subset of the patients failed to provide information on a mechanism for the possible increased incidence of gallbladder disease."

True,small amount capsaicin administered subcutaneously right forehead evoke burning painful sensation first division trigeminal nervecapsaicin chemical makes chilis spicy put skin causes pain,9514561,capsaicin,painful,"Using a positron emission tomography (PET) study it was shown recently that in migraine without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the headache state, but not in the headache free interval. It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called 'migraine generator'. To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the migraine patients. A small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Increases of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were found bilaterally in the insula, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum. Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state. The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however, suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such, rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache."
False,increased splenic iron content erythrocyte injury observed treatment low dose cisplatinnan,20540689,iron,splenic,"Cisplatin is one of the commonly-used chemotherapeutic drugs to efficiently treat malignant tumors in clinic, however, the adverse effects of cisplatin such as nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and hemolytic uremic syndrome are often observed at its clinical doses (approximately 60 mg/m(2)), which limit its broader application. In earlier studies, little attention was paid to the subtle changes in the architecture of lymphatic organs after low doses of cisplatin treatment. This paper reviews current understanding of cisplatin-induced erythrocyte injury, and presents our latest finding that a low dose of cisplatin (3.6 mg/m(2)/day, 14 days) could induce specific hemosiderin deposition in spleen of both normal and hepatoma-22 (H22) inoculated Balb/C mice. This dose of cisplatin significantly inhibited H22-induced acute ascites development. No significant toxicity was induced by this dose of cisplatin to tissues except for hemosiderin accumulation in the spleen of both normal and H22 tumor-bearing mice. Increased splenic iron content and erythrocyte injury were observed after treatment with the low dose of cisplatin. The mRNA levels of ferroportin (FPN1) and ferritin were upregulated by 25 and 5-fold in spleen, respectively. Overexpression of FPN1 and ferritin protein were also been observed at protein levels by Western blotting analysis. In addition, the mRNA expression of hepcidin was also increased, suggesting blockage of iron recycling through FPN1 in spleen with cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, cisplatin treatment damages the erythrocytes which accumulate in the red pulp of spleen with defective recycling of FPN1 and ferritin protein. Hepcidin inhibits the function of FPN1 as iron-exporter leading to iron overloaded inside ferritins of splenic cells, which are stained with abnormal hemosiderin accumulation. These results demonstrate that cisplatin-caused hemosiderin deposition in spleen provides a valuable clue for understanding the molecular basis of toxicity of cisplatin and hemosiderin accumulation and iron metabolism in vivo."

These NHC-precursors were then reacted with silver(i) acetate to yield the NHC-silver complexes (1-methyl-3-(4-cyanobenzyl)imidazole-2-ylidene)silver(i)acetate (4a), (4,5-dichloro-1-(4-cyanobenzyl)-3-methyl)imidazole-2-ylidene)silver(i)acetate (4b), (1-methyl-3-(4-cyanobenzyl)benzimidazole-2-ylidene)silver(i)acetate (4c), (1,3-bis(4-cyanobenzyl)5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole-2-ylidene) silver(i) acetate (4d), (1,3-dibenzyl-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole-2-ylidene) silver(i) acetate (4e) and (1,3-dibenzyl-4,5-diphenylimidazol-2-ylidene) silver(i) acetate (4f) respectively. Three NHC-precursors 3c-e and four NHC-silver complexes 4b and 4d-f were characterised by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Preliminary in vitro antibacterial activity of the NHC-precursors and NHC-silver complexes was investigated against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli using the qualitative Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion method. NHC-silver complexes have shown very high antibacterial activity compared to the NHC-precursors. All six NHC-silver complexes were tested for their cytotoxicity through MTT based in vitro tests on the human renal-cancer cell line Caki-1 in order to determine their IC₅₀ values. NHC-silver complexes 4a-f were found to have IC₅₀ values of 6.2 (±1.0), 7.7 (±1.6), 1.2 (±0.6), 10.8 (±1.9), 24.2 (±1.8) and 13.6 (±1.0) μM, respectively. These values represent improved cytotoxicity against Caki-1, most notably for 4c, which is a three times more cytotoxic than cisplatin (IC₅₀ value = 3.3 μM) itself."
True,lung cancer cells knockdown rip substantially increased cisplatin induced apoptotic cytotoxicity associated robust jnk activationnan,24675421,cisplatin,apoptotic cytotoxicity,"The elucidation of chemoresistance mechanisms is important to improve cancer patient survival. In this report, we investigated the role and mechanism through which receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), a mediator in cell survival and death signaling, participates in cancer's response to chemotherapy. In lung cancer cells, knockdown of RIP1 substantially increased cisplatin-induced apoptotic cytotoxicity, which was associated with robust JNK activation. The expression of the JNK inactivating phosphatase, MKP1, was substantially reduced in RIP1 knockdown cells. Although MKP1 protein stability was not altered by RIP1 suppression, the synthesis rate of MKP1 was dramatically reduced in RIP1-suppressed cells. Furthermore, we found that the expression of miR-940 was substantially increased in RIP1 knockdown cells. Knockdown of miR-940 restored MKP1 expression and attenuated cisplatin-induced JNK activation and cytotoxicity. Importantly, ectopic expression of MKP1 effectively attenuated cisplatin-induced JNK activation and cytotoxicity. In addition, activation of the JNK upstream signaling kinase, MKK4, was also potentiated in RIP1 knockdown cells. Altogether, our results suggest that RIP1 contributes to cisplatin resistance by suppressing JNK activation that involves releasing miR-940-mediated inhibition of MKP1 and suppressing activation of MKK4. Intervention targeting the RIP1/miR-940/MKP1/JNK pathway may be used to sensitize platinum-based chemotherapy. "

True,olanzapine receptor profile results significant risk bodyweight gain sedationnan,11772153,Olanzapine,bodyweight gain,"Antipsychotics are frequently used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Atypical antipsychotics have come to the forefront in child psychiatry due largely to their tolerability profiles as well as their efficacy. Potential treatment options include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. A number of studies investigating the use of clozapine have been published in children; however, owing to the frequent monitoring required for agranulocytosis, the use of clozapine may be restricted to patients with treatment-refractory disease. With accumulating data on the development of glucose intolerance in adults receiving clozapine, closer monitoring of bodyweight and fasting blood glucose is imperative. Clozapine also has an increased seizure risk, therefore a baseline electroencephalogram should be performed, as well as continued vigilance for this adverse effect. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that is generally well tolerated and numerous studies have been published investigating this drug in children. Unlike clozapine, its receptor interaction profile lends itself toward increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinaemia. Bodyweight gain is a common adverse effect, although somewhat less than that reported with olanzapine. Baseline liver function studies prior to initiation of this medication are recommended. Risperidone-induced mania has been reported in adults and, therefore, increased caution should be used when deciding to treat children and adolescents with risperidone, particularly in those with a predisposition toward mania. Olanzapine, like risperidone, has also been associated with onset of mania in adults. Olanzapine has a receptor profile that results in significant risk for bodyweight gain and sedation. Furthermore, this drug has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance; thus, it is important to monitor bodyweight and fasting blood glucose on a frequent basis. Less information is known about quetiapine in children and adolescents. Reports about its efficacy and tolerability vary. Quetiapine appears to have increased risk for sedation and bodyweight gain, albeit less than that of olanzapine. The compound appears to be less likely to induce EPS. Finally, ziprasidone has recently been approved for use in the adult population. This compound, in terms of its receptor profile, has more in common with risperidone. This suggests a potential for increased risk of EPS and hyperprolactinaemia. It also has an increased risk of QTc prolongation; thus, a baseline electrocardiogram is suggested, particularly in those patients with a history of cardiovascular illness. Lack of evidence for bodyweight gain with ziprasidone is a considerable advantage."

True,apparent calcium chloride dissociate vocalization fighting autonomic motor phenomena mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsions caused carbachol eserine nan,6892185,eserine,tremor,"The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."

BK virus (BKV) has been commonly found to be associated with hematuria in stem cell transplant patients; however, it has rarely been reported after cyclophosphamide chemotherapy alone. The authors present 3 cases of BK viruria with HC in nontransplant pediatric oncology patients. The 3 patients with BKV had more prolonged hematuria (14 to 16 wk) compared with 1 patient with BKV-negative HC (10 wk). The HC necessitated chemotherapy delays and also prolonged supportive care. One patient was treated with intravenous cidofovir with resolution of BK viruria and hematuria. BKV may have an association with the development of HC in nonstem cell transplant patients receiving high-dose oxazophosphorine chemotherapy. HC may present early and be more prolonged in patients with BK viruria. Patients with HC after cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide with negative bacterial cultures should be studied for BKV. Cidofovir may be beneficial in certain patients with BK viruria and HC; however, definitive data will require a clinical trial."

A total of 22 analogs were tested against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), varicella zoster virus (VZV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) and human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8). Ten of the analogs had activity against at least one of the viruses tested. One compound had moderate activity against HSV-1 and six had activity against VZV. All but one compound was active against HCMV with a mean EC50 of 2.1 +/- 0.6 microM, compared with a mean EC50 of 3.9 +/- 0.8 microM for ganciclovir. Of special interest was the fact that eight of the ten compounds were active against both HHV-6A and HHV-6B with mean EC50 values of 6.0 +/- 5.2 mciroM and <2.4 +/- 1.5 microM, respectively. Only two compounds had activity against EBV, whereas all but one compound was active against HHV-8 with a mean EC50 of 3.1 +/- 1.7 microM.

True,observations indicate prolonged depletion adrenergic stores guanethidine induces adrenergic supersensitivity cutaneous vessels adrenergic supersensitivity enhances thermal hyperalgesia presence noradrenalinenan,11474550,guanethidine,thermal hyperalgesia,"Supersensitivity to noradrenaline contributes to certain vascular disorders (e.g., hypertension) and chronic neuropathic pain conditions (e.g., complex regional pain syndrome). We aimed to develop a procedure for inducing adrenergic supersensitivity that could be used to investigate the role of catecholamines in these clinical conditions. In the first study, three doses of guanethidine were administered by iontophoresis to separate small patches of skin in the forearm of healthy human volunteers. Four to five hours later. the vasoconstrictor response to the adrenergic releasing agent tyramine was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by iontophoretic pretreatment with guanethidine, indicating that guanethidine had depleted endogenous adrenergic stores. In a second study, guanethidine and saline were administered by iontophoresis four times over approximately 2 weeks at separate sites in the forearm. One to two days after the final pretreatment, vasoconstriction to the iontophoresis of a weak dose of noradrenaline was enhanced at sites pretreated with guanethidine. To investigate the effect of guanethidine pretreatment on thermal hyperalgesia. the experimental sites were sensitized to heat by the topical application of 0.6% capsaicin. Both before and after the application of capsaicin, the heat-pain threshold and heat-pain ratings to suprathreshold stimulation were similar at sites pretreated for 2 weeks with guanethidine or saline. However, after the iontophoresis of noradrenaline, thermal hyperalgesia was greater at the guanethidine-pretreated site than the saline pretreated site. These observations indicate that prolonged depletion of adrenergic stores by guanethidine induces adrenergic supersensitivity in cutaneous vessels, and that adrenergic supersensitivity enhances thermal hyperalgesia in the presence of noradrenaline."

False,contrast anaesthetised dogs differences seen incidence spontaneous electrical stimulation induced ventricular tachycardia fibrillations among animals exposed levobupivacaine bupivacainenan,11945112,levobupivacaine,ventricular tachycardia,"Bupivacaine is currently the most widely used long-acting local anaesthetic. Its uses include surgery and obstetrics; however, it has been associated with potentially fatal cardiotoxicity, particularly when given intravascularly by accident. Levobupivacaine, a single enantiomer of bupivacaine, has recently been introduced as a new long-acting local anaesthetic with a potentially reduced toxicity compared with bupivacaine. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have compared levobupivacaine with bupivacaine and in most but not all studies there is evidence that levobupivacaine is less toxic. Advantages for levobupivacaine are seen on cardiac sodium and potassium channels, on isolated animal hearts and in whole animals, anaesthetised or awake. In particular the intravascular dose of levobupivacaine required to cause lethality in animals is consistently higher compared with bupivacaine. In awake sheep, for example, almost 78% more levobupivacaine was required to cause death. In contrast, in anaesthetised dogs no differences were seen in the incidence of spontaneous or electrical stimulation- induced ventricular tachycardia and fibrillations among animals exposed to levobupivacaine or bupivacaine. The reversibility of levobupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity has also been assessed. Some data point to an advantage of levobupivacaine over bupivacaine but this potential advantage was not confirmed in a recent study in anaesthetised dogs. Three clinical studies have been conducted using surrogate markers of both cardiac and CNS toxicity. In these studies levobupivacaine or bupivacaine were given by intravascular injection to healthy volunteers. Levobupivacaine was found to cause smaller changes in indices of cardiac contractility and the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and also to have less depressant effect on the electroencephalogram. Assuming that levobupivacaine has the same local anaesthetic potency as bupivacaine, then, all things being equal, it is difficult to argue that levobupivacaine should not displace bupivacaine as the long-acting local anaesthetic of choice. It would appear, however, that levobupivacaine has not yet significantly displaced bupivacaine from the markets in which it is sold. This may be due to a lack of perceived safety benefit and/or consideration of the additional costs that are associated with switching to levobupivacaine, which is approximately 57% more expensive than bupivacaine. If the price of levobupivacaine were closer to bupivacaine then the argument to switch to levobupivacaine would undoubtedly be much stronger. With the continued clinical use of levobupivacaine the database available to make comparisons will increase and this may allow cost-benefit arguments to be made more forcefully for levobupivacaine in the future."

A total of 271 E. coli isolates from our institution were tested over a 10-year period. Screening for quinolone resistance (qnr) gene was performed. A decline in susceptibility of E. coli isolates to quinolones and aminoglycosides was noted over the 10-year span (P < 0.0001), which was significantly reduced compared with the average susceptibility of all sites. Introduction of quinolone prophylaxis has led to a significant decline in susceptibility of E. coli to all quinolones. The organisms remain susceptible to carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Periodic surveillance allows for detection of resistance patterns and adjustment of empiric antibiotic choice in patients at high risk for infection."

The TGF-beta 2 isoform has been shown to be present in high concentrations in breast cyst fluid and might have a protective role in breast cancer. In addition, oestrogens play an important role in breast cancer development, and oestrone sulphate (E1S) might be the main source of active oestrogens in the breast. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of TGF-beta 2 on oestrogen synthesis in an attempt to understand the mechanism by which TGF-beta 2 may exert a protective effect in breast cancer. In this study, higher concentrations of TGF-beta 2 significantly inhibited the conversion of E1S to oestrone (E1) and the conversion of E1 to the potent oestrogen, oestradiol (E2). TGF-beta 2 did not have any effect on MCF-7 cell growth or on E2 to E1 conversion. In conclusion, TGF-beta 2 might exert a protective role in breast cancer by reducing the amount of active oestrogens present in the breast."
False,raserk signaling pathway involved curcumin induced cell cycle arrest apoptosis human gastric carcinoma ags cellsnan,25492214,curcumin,gastric carcinoma,"Curcumin, the biologically active compound from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, could inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in gastric carcinoma. However, the underlying mechanism of curcumin on gastric carcinoma cells still needs further investigation. In this study, morphological observation indicated that curcumin inhibited the proliferation of AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner. According to the flow cytometric analysis, curcumin treatment resulted in G2/M arrest in AGS cells, accompanied with an increased expression of cyclin B1 and a decreased expression of cyclin D1. In addition, DNA ladders were observed by gel electrophoresis. Meanwhile, the activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9 were also enhanced in curcumin-treated AGS cells. Nevertheless, the increased activities could be inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OME)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), which suggested that the apoptosis was caspase-dependent. Furthermore, downregulation of rat sarcoma (Ras) and upregulation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were also observed in AGS cells treated with curcumin by Western blot. U0126, an ERK inhibitor, blocked curcumin-induced apoptosis. The results suggested that curcumin inhibited the growth of the AGS cells and induced apoptosis through the activation of Ras/ERK signaling pathway and downstream caspase cascade, and curcumin might be a potential target for the treatment of gastric carcinoma.

The objective of this study was to describe the blood folate status and examine the predictors of blood folate status in a national sample of adults from New Zealand, a country with voluntary folic acid fortification. The 2008/09 New Zealand Adult Nutrition Survey was a nationwide multistage systematic random cross-sectional survey. Serum and erythrocyte folate concentrations were measured by microbiologic assay. The survey included 4721 participants aged ≥15 y, 3359 of whom provided a nonfasting blood sample. Biochemical folate status was measured in 3277 participants. The median serum and erythrocyte folate concentrations were 23 and 809 nmol/L, respectively. The prevalence of biochemical folate deficiency, defined as plasma folate <6.8 nmol/L or erythrocyte folate <305 nmol/L, was 2%. Having breakfast daily compared with never eating breakfast was associated with 53% higher serum and 25% higher erythrocyte folate concentrations; consumers of fortified yeast extract spread had 17% higher serum and 14% higher erythrocyte folate concentrations than nonconsumers; daily users of folate-containing supplements compared with nonusers had 48% higher serum and 28% higher erythrocyte folate concentrations. The prevalence of biochemical folate deficiency in New Zealand adults is low. Participants who ate breakfast more frequently, consumed folate-fortified yeast, or used a daily folate supplement had higher blood folate concentrations."

There was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earlier. The patient was admitted with a pulmonary-renal syndrome with hemoptysis, rapidly progressive renal failure, and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient recovered cardiac rhythm. The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia. This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP). These mechanisms are not well understood because, in most cases, the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event. Rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here, and the authors discount ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism."

False,include forced hyperventilation paco coma experimental protocols tris buffer indomethacin induced hypothermianan,18286835,indomethacin,coma,"Intracranial pressure (ICP) is the pressure exerted by cranial contents on the dural envelope. It comprises the partial pressures of brain, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Normal intracranial pressure is somewhere below 10 mmHg; it may increase as a result of traumatic brain injury, stroke, neoplasm, Reye's syndrome, hepatic coma, or other pathologies. When ICP increases above 20 mmHg it may damage neurons and jeopardize cerebral perfusion. If such a condition persists, treatment is indicated. Control of ICP requires measurement, which can only be performed invasively. Standard techniques include direct ventricular manometry or measurement in the parenchyma with electronic or fiberoptic devices. Displaying the time course of pressure (high-resolution ICP tonoscopy) allows assessment of the validity of the signal and identification of specific pathological findings, such as A-, B- and C-waves. When ICP is pathologically elevated--at or above 20-25 mmHg--it needs to be lowered. A range of treatment modalities is available and should be applied with consideration of the underlying cause. When intracranial hypertension is caused by hematoma, contusion, tumor, hygroma, hydrocephalus or pneumatocephalus, surgical treatment is indicated. In the absence of a surgically treatable condition, ICP may be controlled by correcting the patient's position, temperature, ventilation or hemodynamics. If intracranial hypertension persists, drainage of CSF via external drainage is most effective. Other first-tier options include induced hypocapnea (hyperventilation; paCO2 < 35 mmHg), hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol, hypertonic saline) and induced arterial hypertension (CPP concept). When autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is compromised, hyperoncotic treatment aimed at reducing vasogenic edema and intracranial blood volume may be applied. When intracranial hypertension persists, second-tier treatments may be indicated. These include 'forced hyperventilation' (paCO2 < 25 mmHg), barbiturate coma or experimental protocols such as tris buffer, indomethacin or induced hypothermia. The last resort is emergent bilateral decompressive craniectomy; once taken into consideration, it should be performed without undue delay."

False,nickel hypersensitivity serious health problem individualnan,2406062,Nickel,hypersensitivity,"Several reports indicate that the prevalence of nickel sensitivity among females in the general population is around 10 per cent and probably is increasing, especially in schoolchildren. It has been claimed that there is such a high correlation between a positive history of nickel hypersensitivity and patch-test results that testing is unnecessary if there is a history of hypersensitivity. This is not true. Nickel hypersensitivity itself is not a serious health problem for the individual. However, when hand eczema also is present, the situation is quite different. Concerns about medical metal implants in nickel-sensitive persons appear to have been exaggerated, and nickel intake in food probably is not a serious difficulty, although some persons may be unusually sensitive. In dealing with the clinical problems of nickel dermatitis, we must not overlook prophylaxis. It seems important to introduce safe methods of ear piercing (a primary source of nickel hypersensitivity) and to spread information about the health hazard potential of the seemingly harmless sensitivity to nickel."
True,present review addresses additional scientific data became available atsdr  evaluations magnitude offset weight evidence numerous epidemiological studies exposure pcbs causally associated human cancer conclusion year later meaningful evidence pcbs posed carcinogenic risk humansnan,14594106,PCBs,cancer,"In 1999 the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) released a Draft Toxicological Profile for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). In reviewing the potential human carcinogenicity of PCBs, ATSDR (1999) concluded that ""The weight of evidence does not support a causal association for PCBs and human cancer at this time."" Just 1 year later, in an updated Toxicological Profile for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), the conclusions of another analysis (ATSDR, 2000) on whether exposure to PCBs might represent a carcinogenic risk to humans had dramatically changed to ""Overall, the human studies provide some evidence that PCBs are carcinogenic"" and ""some of these studies provide meaningful evidence that PCBs are carcinogenic in humans."" Because this is a substantially different conclusion than that reached only one year previously, it raises a number of questions that must be considered particularly since ""weight of evidence"" has a precise meaning in the context of evaluating a body of epidemiological data. The present review addresses the additional scientific data that became available between the ATSDR 1999 and 2000 evaluations that was of a magnitude to offset the weight of evidence from numerous epidemiological studies that exposure to PCBs was not causally associated with human cancer to a conclusion only 1 year later that there was now ""meaningful evidence"" that PCBs posed a carcinogenic risk to humans. Also of interest are the criteria upon which this conclusion is based and the distinction between ""weight of evidence"" and the newer descriptors of ""some evidence"" and ""meaningful evidence."" However, as shown in this review, only one relevant study was published between the ATSDR 1999 and 2000 evaluations and the results of this study were unequivocally supportive of the 1999 conclusion. Because of the continuing controversy surrounding this issue, in this review, all relevant epidemiological data on PCBs are summarized and subjected to another weight of evidence evaluation. This critical review is based on the most recent guidelines (U.S. EPA, 1999a, 2003) for conducting weight-of-evidence evaluations on a body of epidemiological data. Applying a weight-of-evidence evaluation to the PCB epidemiological studies can only lead to the conclusion that there is no causal relationship between PCB exposure and any form of cancer, thereby confirming the conclusions of ATSDR (1999). Also considered is the methodology and logic used by ATSDR (2000) that resulted in overturning the weight of evidence conclusions concerning the human carcinogenicity of PCBs in ATSDR (1999). This issue may have public health and policy implications. It seems appropriate that unbiased evaluations of a body of data, even of controversial issues such as the potential human carcinogenicity of PCBs, be conducted in a transparent manner following applicable guidelines. The dramatic differences between the conclusions of ATSDR (1999) and ATSDR (2000) do not appear to be consistent with this process."

False,review describes relationships low serum testosterone concentrations ed obese patients metabolic syndrome type diabetes mellitusnan,18843273,testosterone,obese,"Obesity is an important risk factor for many common diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, cancer and erectile dysfunction (ED). Adipose tissues produce a number of adipokines and cytokines, which affect endothelial and metabolic function resulting in insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (risks factors for CVD). Both ED and metabolic syndrome improve with a reduction in body mass index (BMI). The relationships among obesity, metabolic syndrome, ED, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and serum total and free testosterone levels are complex and often confusing to the physician. It is known that BMI is inversely proportional to serum total testosterone concentrations; low serum SHBG levels in obesity contribute to the low serum total testosterone. Recent studies show that BMI is also inversely proportional to free testosterone concentration. The characteristic low serum testosterone concentrations observed in obese men are also present in men with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. A small proportion of men with ED have hypogonadism; however, the proportion increases if these men are obese with manifestations of the metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus. ED is a common symptom in patients with type 2 diabetes who also have low testosterone levels. This review describes the relationships between low serum testosterone concentrations and ED in obese patients and those with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Changes in serum ferritin (DF%), and liver, spleen and marrow to paraspinous muscles signal intensity ratios (SI) in T1-wTSE sequence were calculated as D%=[(2(nd)value-1(st) value)/1(st) value] x100%. Negative DF% and positive D(SI)% indicated reduction of iron. Although 17/21 (80.9%) patients demonstrated reduction in ferritin, only 8/21 (38%), 7/21 (33.3%) and 7/21 (33.3%) patients had decreased liver, spleen and marrow iron. Patients undergoing combined therapy showed significantly greater reduction (Student's t-test, p < 0.05) or less increase (t-test, p <0.05) in iron stores. Combined therapy is more effective than DFO for removing and preventing liver, spleen and bone marrow iron accumulation in beta-thalassemic patients. Magnetic resonance imaging is valuable for organ-specific monitoring of chelation therapy."

Western blot analysis showed that GM2E1, but not GMneo, expressed a protein that reacted with anti-human P450 2E1 antibody. The 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase,p-nitrophenol hydroxylase, and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) demethylase activities of the P450 in these cells were measured in monolayer cell cultures without preparing microsomes. Exposure of the GM2E1 cells to NDMA for 4 days caused severe decreases in cell viability, as determined by crystal violet uptake, and showed a sigmoidal dose-response curve with a median lethal dose of 17 microM. In contrast, the viability of GMneo cells was not altered by NDMA even at concentrations up to 10 mM. Time- and concentration-dependent methylation of DNA, RNA and protein by [14C]NDMA was only observed in cells expressing P450 2E1. Inhibitors of P450 2E1 activity such as ethanol, 4-methylpyrazole, and isoniazid caused a 90% decrease in the methylation of cellular macromolecules and also completely protected the cells against NDMA-mediated toxicity. The cytotoxicity due to exposure to NDMA was partially inhibited by antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole and N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone but was not potentiated upon glutathione depletion. These results document the ability of rat P450 2E1 to metabolize NDMA to toxic reactive intermediates and demonstrate that this cell line provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of metabolism-mediated toxicity and carcinogenesis."

As some studies have reported a much higher incidence of motor block and opioid-related side effects with 0.2% ropivacaine in combination with 4 microg/mL fentanyl, it was our intent to analyze the data of our patients who had received PCEA after upper abdominal surgery. In addition to comparing the analgesic effects and the incidence of motor block and opioid-related side effects of these three different ropivacaine/fentanyl solutions, we also evaluated the workload of our pain staff. The main purpose of our study was to determine which of these three regimens of ropivacaine was most satisfactory with the least workload for the pain service staff."

True,nicotine wellknown unpleasant side effects eg transient dizziness nausea nicotine induced nystagmus ninnan,17990061,Nicotine,dizziness,"Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."

True,knowing heart mitochondria represent almost heart muscle weight conclude deteriorating effects adr cardiovascular function involve mitochondrial structural functional impairment nan,9952311,ADR,mitochondrial structural and functional impairment,"The use of adriamycin (ADR) in cancer chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative cardiovascular toxicity. Earlier observations that ADR interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate ADR's action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb-c mice i.p. treated with ADR for several weeks. At various times during treatment, the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy. In parallel, total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady-state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII, COXIII, and COXIV genes. Similarly, samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies. Our results indicated that 1) treatment of mice with ADR caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia, extension of ventricular depolarization time (tQRS), and failure of QRS at high concentrations (10-14 mg/kg body weight cumulative dose); 2) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling, fusion, dissolution, and/or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment. Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue; and 3) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined, only COXII gene expression was suppressed by ADR treatment, mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver. Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40% of heart muscle by weight, we conclude that the deteriorating effects of ADR on cardiovascular function involve mitochondrial structural and functional impairment."
True,development obstructive sleep apnea syndrome must considered possible side effect androgen therapynan,6732043,androgen,obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,"We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54-yr-old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea while being administered exogenous androgens. When the androgens were withdrawn, the patient's physical changes, symptoms, sleep study, and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal. A rechallenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone. Previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. Our report provides direct evidence for this role. Structural and functional measurements indicate that androgens exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep. Development of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome must be considered a possible side effect of androgen therapy."
True,ketanserin nm antagonized part 5-ht induced contractions nan,8789380,5-HT,contractions,"1. We investigated the hypothesis that, as in some other large human arteries, 5-HT-induced contraction of the temporal artery is mediated through two co-existing receptor populations, 5-HT1-like- and 5-HT2A. Temporal arterial segments were obtained from patients undergoing brain surgery and rings prepared set up to contract with 5-HT and related agents. Fractions of maximal 5-HT responses mediated through 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2A receptors, f1 and f2 = 1-f1, were estimated by use of the 5-HT2A-selective antagonist ketanserin. 2. In rings with intact endothelium 5-HT evoked contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.0. Ketanserin (10-1000 nM) antagonized part of the 5-HT-induced contractions. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M of 6.9 and f1 of 0.17 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 6.4 and f1 of 0.20 (1000 nM ketanserin). 3. In rings with endothelial function attenuated by enzymatic treatment, 5-HT caused contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.2 that were partially blocked by ketanserin. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M 7.4 and f1 of 0.16 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 7.5 and f1 of 0.14 (1000 nM ketanserin). 4. The ketanserin-resistant component of 5-HT-evoked contraction was blocked by methiothepin (100-1000 nM) consistent with mediation through 5-HT1-like receptors. 5. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT1-like-selective agonist, sumatriptan, caused small contractions with a -log EC50, M of 6.5 and intrinsic activity of 0.21 with respect to 5-HT that were resistant to blockade by 1000 nM ketanserin but antagonized by 100 nM methiothepin. 6. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT2A receptor partial agonist SK&F 103829 (2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-8[methyl sulphonyl]-1H3-benzazepin-7-ol methensulphonate) contracted rings with a -log EC50, M of 5.0 and an intrinsic activity of 0.49 with respect to 5-HT; the effects were antagonized by ketanserin 1000 nM. 7. We conclude that 80-86% of the maximum 5-HT-evoked contraction of human temporal artery is mediated through 5-HT2A receptors, the remainder through 5-HT1-like-receptors, regardless of whether or not endothelium is functional. The 5-HT1-like-receptors are more likely to be 5-HT1D beta receptors than 5-HT1D alpha receptors and sumatriptan is a full agonist for these receptors. As found in arteries of other species, SK&F 103829 is a partial agonist for 5-HT2A receptors of human temporal artery."
True,findings illustrate pb may associated chronic liver damage may lead serious deleterious consequencesnan,17574447,PB,liver damage,"Phenobarbital (PB) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that PB-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver disease. Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of epilepsy treated with PB who died suddenly: one as consequence of cardiac arrest, the other of acute bronchopneumonia. At autopsy, analysis of liver parenchyma revealed rich portal inflammatory infiltrate, which consisted of mixed eosinophil and monocyte cells, associated with several foci of necrosis surrounded by a hard ring of non-specific granulomatous tissue. Inflammatory reactions of internal and external hepatic biliary ducts were also seen. Our findings illustrate that PB may be associated with chronic liver damage, which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences. For this reason, each clinician should recognize this entity in the differential diagnosis of PB-related asymptomatic chronic hepatic enzyme dysfunction."
False,refractory gcse often difficult treat traditional therapy barbiturates induces hypotension respiratory depression prolongs recoverynan,10516875,barbiturates,GCSE,"Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is a medical emergency requiring prompt resolution. Acute treatment is often delayed by difficulty in obtaining intravenous (i.v.) access. Refractory GCSE is often difficult to treat, and traditional therapy with barbiturates induces hypotension and respiratory depression and prolongs recovery. Midazolam is particularly useful for treating acute GCSE because it has an imidazole ring that is open at low pH, allowing it to be dissolved in aqueous solution for intramuscular injection, but closed at physiologic pH, increasing lipophilicity and rendering good intramuscular absorption, brain penetration, and fast onset of action. When given intramuscularly as a 0.2 mg/kg bolus, it has efficacy at least equal to that of i.v. diazepam, is well tolerated, induces little respiratory compromise, and has a shorter latency to onset of action. Therefore, it should be considered for the treatment of acute GCSE when i.v. access is problematic. For refractory GCSE, continuous i.v. midazolam infusion at 0.1-0.6 mg/kg/hr after a 0.2 mg/kg i.v. bolus is effective and has advantages over traditional therapies because it induces less hypotension and cardiorespiratory depression and can be easily titrated. Further prospective studies are needed to define the role of continuous i.v. midazolam compared to other contemporary therapies."

True,findings demonstrate first time cell transformation tumorigenesis induced cadmium due least part overexpression tef delta novel cadmium responsive protooncogenenan,11711542,cadmium,tumorigenesis,"The molecular mechanisms potentially responsible for cadmium-induced cell transformation and tumorigenesis were investigated using Balb/c-3T3 cells transformed with cadmium chloride. Differential display analysis of gene expression revealed consistent and reproducible overexpression of a transcript in the transformed cells compared with the nontransformed cells. The full-length cDNA corresponding to the differentially expressed transcript was cloned and was identified as mouse translation elongation factor-1 delta subunit (TEF-1 delta; GenBank accession number ). Nucleotide sequence analysis of TEF-1 delta cDNA revealed an open reading frame encoding the predicted protein of 281 amino acids and exhibited significant conservation with the corresponding protein of human, Xenopus laevis, and Artemia. The presence of a leucine zipper motif, characteristic of translation elongation factor-1 delta, was also found in the mouse TEF-1 delta. A 31-kDa protein was detected in eukaryotic cells transfected with an expression vector containing the TEF-1 delta cDNA. Overexpression of the TEF-1 delta protein by transfection was oncogenic in NIH3T3 cells as evidenced by the appearance of transformed foci exhibiting anchorage-independent growth and the potential to grow as tumors in nude mice. Blocking the translation of TEF-1 delta with antisense TEF-1 delta mRNA resulted in a significant reversal of the oncogenic potential of cadmium-transformed Balb/c-3T3 cells as evidenced from suppression in anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis in nude mice. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that the cell transformation and tumorigenesis induced by cadmium are due, at least in part, to the overexpression of TEF-1 delta, a novel cadmium-responsive proto-oncogene."

False,performed proteomic analysis liver specimens yearold woman affected hepatitis genotype alcoholism diabetes mellitus type antiviral treatment pegylated interferon alpha ribavirinnan,23529134,pegylated interferon alpha 2b,diabetes mellitus,"Lipid pathway impairment, decrease in the antioxidant pool and downregulation in amino-acid metabolism are just some of the metabolic variations attributed to chronic HCV infection. All of them have been studied separately, mainly in animal models. Thanks to proteomic analysis we managed to describe (for the fist time to the best of our knowledge), in vivo and in humans, the metabolic alterations caused by HCV, and the recovery of the same alterations during HCV treatment. We performed proteomic analysis on liver specimens of a 28-year-old woman affected by hepatitis C genotype 1a, alcoholism and diabetes mellitus type 1, before and after antiviral treatment with pegylated interferon alpha 2b and ribavirin. The subject, thanks to a patient-tailored therapy, reached Sustained Virological Response. Throughout the treatment period the patient was monitored with subsequent biochemical, clinical and psychological examinations. The data obtained by the patient's close monitoring suggest a direct interaction between insulin resistance and an active HCV genotype 1 infection, with a leading role played by the infection, and not by insulin resistance, as demonstrated by the sharp fall of the insulin units needed per day during treatment. The proteomic analysis showed that after therapy, a downregulation of enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and alcohol catabolism takes place, the latter probably due to cessation of alcohol abuse. On the contrary, the metabolic pathways linked to metabolism of the reactive oxygen species were upregulated after therapy. Finally, a significant alteration in the pathway regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA), a major regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver, was reported. These ""real time"" data confirm in vivo, in humans, that during HCV infection, the pathways related to fatty acids, glucose metabolism and free radical scavenging are inhibited. The same enzyme deficit is completely recovered after HCV eradication."
True,study designed evaluate effects pilocarpine explore underlying ionic mechanism using aconitineinduced rat ouabain induced guinea pig arrhythmia modelstwo animal models used study one rat model arrhythmia induced aconitine second guinea pig model induced ouabain,19721134,ouabain,arrhythmia,"This study was designed to evaluate the effects of pilocarpine and explore the underlying ionic mechanism, using both aconitine-induced rat and ouabain-induced guinea pig arrhythmia models. Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular free-calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in isolated myocytes. The current data showed that pilocarpine significantly delayed onset of arrhythmias, decreased the time course of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, reduced arrhythmia score, and increased the survival time of arrhythmic rats and guinea pigs. [Ca(2+)](i) overload induced by aconitine or ouabain was reduced in isolated myocytes pretreated with pilocarpine. Moreover, M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide) partially abolished the beneficial effects of pilocarpine. These data suggest that pilocarpine produced antiarrhythmic actions on arrhythmic rat and guinea pig models induced by aconitine or ouabain via stimulating the cardiac M(3)-mAChR. The mechanism may be related to the improvement of Ca(2+) handling."

False,relationship oestrogen replacement treatment risk endometrial cancer analysed casecontrol study histologically confirmed incident cases age  controls hospital acute nonneoplastic nonhormonerelated conditions conducted swiss canton vaud nan,8398274,oestrogen,endometrial cancer,"The relationship between oestrogen replacement treatment and the risk of endometrial cancer was analysed in a case-control study of 158 histologically confirmed incident cases below the age of 75 and 468 controls in hospital for acute, non-neoplastic, non-hormone-related conditions conducted in the Swiss Canton of Vaud in 1988-1992. Overall, 60 (38%) cases vs. 93 (20%) controls had ever used oestrogen replacement treatment: the corresponding multiple logistic regression relative risk (RR) was 2.7 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.7-4.1). The risk was directly related to duration of use, and rose to 5.1 (95% CI: 2.7-9.8) for > 5 year-use. The RR was still significantly elevated 10 or more years after stopping use (RR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2-4.5). When the role of covariates was considered, a significant interaction was observed with body mass index (RR for long-term oestrogen use = 6.0 for lean or normal weight women vs. 2.4 for overweight women). There was also a hint of a negative interaction with oral contraceptive (OC) use, since the RR for oestrogens was higher (or restricted) to women who had never used OC (RR = 5.4, for long-term oestrogen use), as compared with those who had used OC, who showed no significant evidence of association with oestrogens (RR = 0.9 for long-term use). There was no significant interaction with cigarette smoking. Thus, this study confirms the presence of a strong association between oestrogen replacement treatment and endometrial cancer risk, since in the late 1980s or early 1990s about 25% of cases could be attributed to oestrogen replacement treatment in this Swiss population. Further, it confirms the presence of significant negative interactions of oestrogen use with obesity, and, possibly, with OC as well."

False,small molecules mimic biological activity mimetics bypass cholinergic receptor activation anticipated provide multiple pathways treating circumventing dementia alzheimers diseasenan,15974915,NO,dementia,"Nitric oxide is multifunctional messenger molecule in the brain, playing important roles including in learning and memory and in regulating the expression of trophic factors that may be reduced with aging. Small molecules that mimic the biological activity of NO, NO mimetics, will bypass cholinergic receptor activation and are anticipated to provide multiple pathways of treating and circumventing dementia in Alzheimer's disease. Activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase and cGMP formation in the brain represents one element of effective neuroprotective pathways mediated by NO. Substantial evidence suggests that NO mimetics may display cGMP-dependent and cGMP-independent activity and may operate via multiple biochemical signaling pathways, both to ensure the survival of neurons subjected to stress and also to provide cognition-enabling pathways to circumvent dementia. GT 1061 is an NO mimetic compound currently in clinical trials for Alzheimer's. A survey of current research indicates that NO mimetics will provide a combined neuroprotective and cognition-enabling approach to anti-neurodegenerative therapy."

Prompted by a case of clozapine-related pericarditis in an adolescent, we undertook a retrospective chart review to discover whether any unrecognized cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy were among the children, adolescents, and young adults we had treated with clozapine. The sample comprised a total of 36 patients, who were monitored regularly over a period ranging from 2.5 to 79 months. The average observation period was 7.5 months. Patients were assessed for potential indicators of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. In more than 66% of all patients, at least one of several parameters potentially indicative of pericarditis, myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy was abnormal in at least one instance during the observation period. In all cases in which abnormalities were discovered, the abnormalities were found to be unspecific for myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. With the exception of the case which prompted our study, none of the patients were found to have developed any such disorder in the course of further treatment with clozapine."
False,recently demonstrated leflunomide anti tumor necrosis factor tnf agents effective psa psoriasisnan,12463452,leflunomide,tumor,"As erosive and deforming arthritis is present in 40% of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), early and aggressive treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be as effective in controlling the progression of the disease as it is for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), and cyclosporine (CsA) are the most widely used DMARDs in the treatment of PsA and are safe and effective in patients with active peripheral arthritis, although they do not appear to be effective on axial manifestations. No controlled study has evaluated the efficacy of these drugs on the progression of radiological damage. It has recently been demonstrated that leflunomide and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are effective in PsA and psoriasis. The symptomatic improvement has been important and sustained and side effects minimal. In particular, inhibitors of TNF appear to have excellent potential to treat PsA. These agents are able to slow joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis and they are effective on spinal symptoms in ankylosing spondylitis. Hopefully, these findings will prove true in PsA as well."

Recently, vigabatrin-induced visual field constriction (VFC) and abnormal ocular electrophysiological studies were reported. In this study, we assessed visual fields, visual evoked potentials (VEPs), and electroretinography (ERG) in children treated with vigabatrin. Twenty-four visually asymptomatic children underwent a clinical ophthalmological examination, perimetry when appropriate, and VEP and ERG. Thirteen patients had at least one abnormal study. VFC was seen in 11 of 17 patients who had perimetry; 5 of 15 patients who underwent VEP testing and 4 of 11 who underwent ERG testing had abnormal examinations. For the most part, abnormal VEPs and ERGs were found in children who also had VFC. There was a consistent trend for longer treatment periods to correlate with VFC, abnormal ERGs, and VEPs. In summary, over half of the children treated with vigabatrin demonstrated VFC or abnormal ocular electrophysiological studies. Perimetry seemed to be the most sensitive modality for identifying vigabatrin toxicity. Abnormal ERGs and VEPs were primarily seen in children with VFC and may be useful in monitoring children who are not appropriate candidates for perimetry. Although the incidence of vigabatrin-induced VFC is worrisome, in the context of intractable seizures or infantile spasms, therapeutic benefits must be weighed against risks."

False,furthermore association evident polymorphic forms susceptibility schizophrenia variable clozapine responsenan,9278187,clozapine,schizophrenia,"For the past 20 years the most enduring explanation for schizophrenia has been the dopamine hypothesis, which proposes that the dopaminergic system is overactive in this widespread disease. Classically, the D2 receptor formed the core of the dopamine hypothesis since there was considerable evidence for elevations of D2 receptor levels in the brains of schizophrenic patients, and because these receptors served as the primary target in mediating antipsychotic effects of most neuroleptics. However, the dopamine D4 receptor has recently received particular attention in this context. This is because the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, which is effective in treating refractory schizophrenics without the side-effect profile of typical neuroleptics, displays a 10-fold higher affinity for D4 compared to D2 or D3 receptors. Furthermore, the concentration in plasma water of clinical doses ofclozapine correlates well with its in vitro binding affinity for D4, but not D2 or D3 receptors, suggesting that D4 is a potential target in mediating clozapine's antipsychotic effects. As well, marked elevations in the level of a D4-like site (not identical to the D4 receptor) has been seen in the striatum of postmortem schizophrenic brains, but not in control brains. Finally, the most interesting feature of the D4 receptor is perhaps the array of polymorphisms associated with it, creating structural diversity in this receptor that supercedes all other known catecholamine receptors. The existence of these D4 polymorphisms raises the possibility that structural variations of this receptor may be associated with an increased susceptibility to schizophrenia, or observed variations in individual response to clozapine treatment. However, several studies aimed at investigating these hypotheses could not establish a direct role of D4 in schizophrenia. Furthermore, no association was evident between the polymorphic forms of D4 and susceptibility to schizophrenia, or variable clozapine response. Nevertheless, investigations surrounding this receptor has been far from futile. The observations which support the idea that D4 might serve as a target for clozapine have significantly modified and extended our understanding of mechanisms underlying atypical antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia, as well as the dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia. Further characterization of this receptor may prove to be crucial in designing highly effective antipsychotic drugs with minimal contraindications."
True,commonly agreed people high blood ldl cholesterol higher risk coronary artery disease cad people low blood ldl cholesterol nan,11835697,cholesterol,coronary artery disease/CAD,"It is commonly agreed that people with a high blood LDL-cholesterol will have a higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) than people with low blood LDL-cholesterol. Due to the increasingly high costs of medication in Thailand, the government has set up several measures to combat the problem. One of such strategies is to promote the utilization of locally manufactured drug products, especially those contained in the National Drug List. Simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is listed as an essential drug for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Here, we reported the study on the LDL-cholesterol-lowering effect of a generic simvastatin product in comparison with the Zocor, in 43 healthy thai volunteers."
False,assumed pravastatin mgday hypercholesterolemia nan,7604176,pravastatin,hypercholesterolemia,"A case of acute inflammatory myopathy associated with the use of pravastatin, a new hydrophilic 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaril coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, is reported. The patient, a 69-year-old man was affected by non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He assumed pravastatin (20 mg/day) because of hypercholesterolemia. He was admitted with acute myopathy of the lower limbs which resolved in a few days after pravastatin discontinuation. A previously unknown hypothyroidism, probably due to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, was evidenced. Muscle biopsy (left gastrocnemius) revealed a perimysial and endomysial inflammatory infiltrate with a prevalence of CD4+ lymphocytes. While lovastatin and simvastatin have been associated with toxic myopathy, pravastatin-associated myopathy could represent a distinct, inflammatory entity."
False,since hyperlipidemia improved pravastatin atorvastatin niceritrol since levels thyroidstimulating hormone tsh free iuml ngdl respectively patient diagnosed secondary hyperlipidemia hypothyroidism nan,17001111,niceritrol,hypothyroidism,"The patient was a 51-year-old Japanese female who had been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. At the first medical examination, her serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) were 482 and 205 mg/dl, respectively. Since hyperlipidemia was not improved by pravastatin, atorvastatin or niceritrol, and since the levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 were 730 IU/ml and 0.3 ng/dl, respectively, the patient was diagnosed as secondary hyperlipidemia with hypothyroidism. A method for the charge isolation of lipoproteins using capillary isotachophoresis (cITP) is proposed as a clinical application because it allows us to quantitatively measure electronegative low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a potent marker of coronary heart disease. After 5 months of treatment with levothyroxine, Serum TC and LDL-C levels drastically decreased without statin treatment and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased. In the lipoprotein profiles as assessed by cITP after treatment with levothyroxin, all HDL-C subfractions were increased and fast-migrating LDL/electronegative LDL appeared to be greatly reduced after treatment, while the area under the non-modified LDL peak was increased. The cITP analysis was able to obtain more information about coronary risk factors and may be clinically useful for evaluating the effect of treatment with levothyroxine in patients with hypothyroidism and secondary hyperlipidemia."
True,compound also reported active convulsions induced bicuculline picrotoxin strychnine nan,11060714,strychnine,convulsions,"Zaleplon (N-[3-(3-cyanopyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidin-7-yl) phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide) is a non-benzodiazepine recently introduced for clinical use. This agent is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Preclinical studies have shown that the benzodiazepines triazolam and Ro17-1812 can substitute for zaleplon in animals trained to distinguish zaleplon from saline. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can antagonise the discriminative stimulus effect of zaleplon. These findings suggest that zaleplon is recognised by animals as a benzodiazepine agent. Zaleplon is active after ip. and oral administration in a variety of motor performance tests, including locomotor activity, rotarod and the loaded grid. Zaleplon has been shown to be active in a number of different anticonvulsant models, including the pentylenetetrazole, isoniazid and electroshock models. The compound is also reported to be active against convulsions induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin and strychnine. Studies in anxiolytic models suggest that zaleplon may have weak anxiolytic activity. From preclinical studies, it appears zaleplon possesses a reduced risk of tolerance compared to triazolam, is less likely to potentiate the effects of ethanol and is unlikely to produce amnestic effects. In man, zaleplon is rapidly absorbed and undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism. The compound has a plasma half-life of approximately one hour and is metabolised primarily via the aldehyde oxidase system to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. This metabolite, along with other minor metabolites formed in vivo, do not appear to contribute to the activity of zaleplon. Metabolites of zaleplon are excreted primarily via the urine. Phase I studies suggest that single daytime doses of zaleplon up to 15 mg are well-tolerated. Short-term impairment of performance occurs when zaleplon is administered during the day at doses epsilon 20 mg. However, given the short half-life of the compound, significant impairment of daytime performance is unlikely if zaleplon is administered at bedtime or shortly after retiring for the evening. Results from Phase II/III studies suggest that zaleplon (5 - 20 mg) produces a dose-dependent reduction in sleep latency in patients suffering from primary insomnia. The clinical efficacy of zaleplon persists for at least four weeks at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. Studies in patients with a history of drug abuse suggest that the abuse potential of zaleplon (at doses above the therapeutic dose range) is similar to that seen with the benzodiazepine triazolam."
True,pooled analysis monotherapy trials common adverse events occurring  patients twice incidence placebo reported acute phase asenapine monotherapy bipolar mania somnolence dizziness extrapyramidal symptoms eps akathisia increased bodyweight similar nature occurring longerterm monotherapy asenapine nan,21323396,asenapine,somnolence,"Asenapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent available in sublingual formulations (5 or 10 mg) and indicated in the US (Saphris) for the acute treatment, as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, of manic and mixed episodes and in the EU (Sycrest) for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes, in adult patients with bipolar I disorder. In two large (both n = 480), well designed, 3-week trials in adult patients with bipolar I disorder, asenapine monotherapy was significantly more effective than placebo at improving mania symptoms, as assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale total score (YMRS; primary endpoint), with significant differences between the asenapine and placebo groups occurring after 2 days of treatment. In both trials, Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) scale mania severity scores exceeded those of placebo. In one trial, response and remission rates exceeded those of placebo. In a 9-week extension study that recruited completers from the monotherapy trials, there were no significant differences between asenapine and olanzapine groups in terms in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, CGI-BP mania severity scores, YMRS response rates or YMRS remission rates during the extension phase. In the extension study, the efficacy of asenapine monotherapy appeared to be maintained over 40 weeks (total treatment duration of 52 weeks). In a 12-week trial of asenapine as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate, asenapine was more effective than placebo in improving manic symptoms, based on the difference between groups in the YMRS total score at week 3 (primary endpoint). Most adverse events associated with asenapine were of mild to moderate severity, with <7% of asenapine recipients experiencing serious adverse events (vs 7% with placebo). In a pooled analysis of the monotherapy trials, the most common adverse events (occurring in ≥ 5% of patients and at twice the incidence of placebo) reported during acute phase asenapine monotherapy for bipolar mania were somnolence, dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS, other than akathisia) and increased bodyweight, which were similar in nature to those occurring during longer-term monotherapy with asenapine. EPS did not worsen in severity during longer-term asenapine monotherapy. Asenapine had minimal effects on plasma glucose, lipid and prolactin levels over both short- and longer-term treatment periods, and had little pro-arrhythmogenic potential. Further active comparator trials and longer-term tolerability and safety data are required. In the meantime, asenapine is a further option for the management of manic and/or mixed symptoms in patients with bipolar I disorder and may be of particular value for patients who are at high risk for metabolic abnormalities."
True,chart review potential features myocarditis pericarditis cardiomyopathy children adolescents treated clozapine nan,15319023,clozapine,cardiomyopathy,"Clozapine is known to cause cardiac side effects, including myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy. Prompted by a case of clozapine-related pericarditis in an adolescent, we undertook a retrospective chart review to discover whether any unrecognized cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy were among the children, adolescents, and young adults we had treated with clozapine. The sample comprised a total of 36 patients, who were monitored regularly over a period ranging from 2.5 to 79 months. The average observation period was 7.5 months. Patients were assessed for potential indicators of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. In more than 66% of all patients, at least one of several parameters potentially indicative of pericarditis, myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy was abnormal in at least one instance during the observation period. In all cases in which abnormalities were discovered, the abnormalities were found to be unspecific for myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. With the exception of the case which prompted our study, none of the patients were found to have developed any such disorder in the course of further treatment with clozapine."
True,study showed spinal neostigmine microg added hyperbaric bupivacaine fentanyl provided significantly longer surgical analgesia insignificant adverse effects male adults lower abdominal surgery spinal anaesthesianan,23185923,neostigmine,analgesia,"The spinal route of analgesia has consolidated its place as a major modality in the management of both acute and chronic pain. The search for ideal additives to local anaesthetic agents to prolong the analgesic effects poses a challenge to the anaesthetists. Neostigmine, an anticholinesterase, presents a novel approach to providing analgesia. Neostigmine, when given intrathecally, inhibits breakdown of an endogenous spinal neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, thereby inducing analgesia. We aimed to determine the analgesic and adverse effects of intrathecal neostigmine combined with hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl."
False,report two hepatitis virus hbv carriers liver failure withdrawal corticosteroids steroids administered treatment serious asthmatic attacksnan,1600269,steroids,asthmatic,We report two hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers who had liver failure after withdrawal of corticosteroids (steroids) administered for treatment of serious asthmatic attacks. Liver functions deteriorated 1 to 2 wk after withdrawal of the steroid therapy and liver failure occurred. Steroid readministration and intensive therapy for liver failure did not prevent death. An excessive immune response provoked by steroid withdrawal and decreased reserve capacity due to underlying chronic liver disease were thought to be factors in the liver failure. Caution must be exercised in the administration of steroids to patients with underlying chronic HBV infection to prevent exacerbation of hepatitis. Prompt readministration of steroids is indicated if evidence of liver failure develops.
False,retrospective prospective analysis involved outbreak isoniazid resistant tuberculosis cases london united kingdom began cases identified one hospital january nan,12734218,isoniazid,tuberculosis,"The aim of this study was to develop a national model and analyze the value of a molecular epidemiological Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA fingerprint-outbreak database. Incidents were investigated by the United Kingdom PHLS Mycobacterium Reference Unit (MRU) from June 1997 to December 2001, inclusive. A total of 124 incidents involving 972 tuberculosis cases, including 520 patient cultures from referred incidents and 452 patient cultures related to two population studies, were examined by using restriction fragment length polymorphism IS6110 fingerprinting and rapid epidemiological typing. Investigations were divided into the following three categories, reflecting different operational strategies: retrospective passive analysis, retrospective active analysis, and retrospective prospective analysis. The majority of incidents were in the retrospective passive analysis category, i.e., the individual submitting isolates has a suspicion they may be linked. Outbreaks were examined in schools, hospitals, farms, prisons, and public houses, and laboratory cross-contamination events and unusual clinical presentations were investigated. Retrospective active analysis involved a major outbreak centered on a high school. Contact tracing of a teenager with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis matched 14 individuals, including members of his class, and another 60 cases were identified in schools clinically and radiologically and by skin testing. Retrospective prospective analysis involved an outbreak of 94 isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis cases in London, United Kingdom, that began after cases were identified at one hospital in January 2000. Contact tracing and comparison with MRU databases indicated that the earliest matched case had occurred in 1995. Subsequently, the MRU changed to an active prospective analysis targeting linked isoniazid-monoresistant isolates for follow up. The patients were multiethnic, born mainly in the United Kingdom, and included professionals, individuals from the music industry, intravenous drug abusers, and prisoners."
True,since introduction immunomodulatory derivatives imids thalidomide lenalidomide therapeutic armamentarium mm vte emerged one leading complications particular patients newly diagnosed mmnan,21455855,thalidomide,VTE,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease with a high prevalence in elderly people, affecting > 5% of the population > 65 years of age. Cancer patients have a 4.3-fold higher incidence of thrombotic complications, due to multiple risk factors that are not always related to the disease. Among hematologic malignancies, multiple myeloma (MM) confers a high risk of developing such complications, with a VTE rate of nearly 10%. Multiple factors are involved in MM-related VTE, such as increased blood viscosity, high levels of immunoglobulin, procoagulant activity of monoclonal protein, and inflammatory cytokines. Since the introduction of the immunomodulatory derivatives (IMiDs) thalidomide and lenalidomide in the therapeutic armamentarium of MM, VTE has emerged as one of the leading complications, in particular in patients with newly diagnosed MM. In this setting, IMiDs-based treatments are associated with rates of VTE reaching values up to 14 to 26%, particularly when dexamethasone or chemotherapy are added. The optimal prophylaxis for patients receiving these antiangiogenetic agents is still a matter of debate. Due to the lack of prospective randomized clinical trials, different studies have used various anticoagulant prophylaxes, including fixed low-dose warfarin (1 mg or 1.25 mg), therapeutic doses of warfarin (international normalized ratio between 2.0 and 3.0), low molecular weight heparin, or low-dose aspirin. As yet, no study has clearly demonstrated a significant superiority of one prophylactic regimen in comparison with the others. Further investigation and more randomized clinical trials are needed to define the best thromboprophylaxis."
False, patients clinical stage whereas clinical stage three months total androgen ablation pathological stage prevalent among patients clinical tumours compared untreated patients treated patients vs untreatednan,10337657,androgen,tumours,"The likelihood of finding organ-confined untreated prostate cancer (PCa) by pathological examination at the time of radical prostatectomy (RP) is only 50% in patients with clinically organ-confined disease. In addition, tumour is present at the resection margin in approximately 30% of clinical T2 (clinical stage B) cases. The issue of clinical ""understaging"" and of resection limit positivity have led to the development of novel management practices, including ""neoadjuvant"" hormonal therapy (NHT). The optimal duration of NHT is unknown. We undertook the present analysis to evaluate the effect of NHT on pathologic stage of PCa and resection limit status in patients with prostate cancer and treated with total androgen ablation either for three or six months before RP. Between January 1996 and February 1998, 259 men with prostate cancer underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic node dissection in the 26 centres participating in the Italian randomised prospective PROSIT study. Whole mount sectioning of the complete RP specimens was adopted in each centre for accurately evaluating the pathologic stage and resection limit status. By February 1998, haematoxylin and eosin stained sections from 155 RP specimens had been received and evaluated by the reviewing pathologist (RM). 64 cases had not been treated with total androgen ablation (e.g. NHT) before RP was performed, whereas 58 and 33 had been treated for three and six months, respectively. 114 patients were clinical stage B whereas 41 were clinical stage C. After three months of total androgen ablation, pathological stage B was more prevalent among patients with clinical B tumours, compared with untreated patients (57% in treated patients vs. 36% in untreated). The percentage of cancers with negative margins was statistically significantly greater in patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy than those treated with immediate surgery alone (69% vs. 42%, respectively). After six months of NHT therapy the proportion of patients with pathological stage B (67% vs. 36%, respectively) and negative margins was greater than after 3 months (92% vs. 42%, respectively). For clinical C tumours, the prevalence of pathological stage B and negative margins in the patients treated for either 3 or 6 months was not as high as in the clinical B tumours, when compared with the untreated group (pathological stage B: 31% and 33% vs. 6% in the clinical C cases, respectively. Negative margins: 56% and 67% vs. 31%, respectively). The initial results of this study suggest that total androgen ablation before RP is beneficial in men with clinical stage B because of the significant pathological downstaging and decrease in the number of positive margins in the RP specimens. These two effects are more pronounced after six months of NHT than after three months of therapy. The same degree of beneficial effects are not observed in clinical C tumours."
False,primary prevention cardioembolic stroke chronic rheumatic heart disease found effective coumadin aspirinnan,7798824,coumadin,cardioembolic stroke,"The comparative study of the efficacy of coumadin and aspirin in primary cardioembolic stroke prevention of chronic rheumatic heart disease (mitral stenosis) with atrial fibrillation was conducted at Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the trial. Allocation of patients into coumadin or aspirin groups depended upon the patients' choice. Nineteen patients were given coumadin at the adjusted dosage to maintain the therapeutic range of International Normalised Ratio between 1.5-3. Sixty patients were given aspirin at the fixed dosage of 75 mg per day. Six patients were lost to follow-up over the 3 yr period; four in the aspirin group and 2 in the coumadin group. There were three patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke in the aspirin group but none in the coumadin group after three years of follow-up. Six patients had mitral valve replacement during the study (i.e. three patients in each group). There were complications in 12 patients, 10 in the aspirin (16.6 per cent) and 2 in the coumadin (10.5 per cent) group. The complications in coumadin group were minor bleeding over the thigh in one patient and generalised ecchymosis over the whole body in one other. In the aspirin group, the complication was gastrointestional symptoms, mainly epigastric pain, but no frank bleeding was observed. Primary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in chronic rheumatic heart disease was found to be more effective with coumadin than aspirin. Our study does not support the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiac embolism in chronic rheumatic heart disease."

The possibility of reproducing the same renal abnormality with captopril was examined in SHR. Oral administration of captopril at 100 mg/kg for 14 days failed to aggravate proteinuria pre-existing in SHR. Also, captopril treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive proteinuria invoked by puromycin aminonucleoside in SHR. Captopril had little or no demonstrable effects on serum electrolyte concentrations, excretion of urine, sodium and potassium, endogenous creatinine clearance, body weight, and food and water consumption. However, ketone bodies were consistently present in urine and several lethalities occurred during multiple dosing of captopril in SHR."

Its precise etio-pathogenesis is evasive, genetic influences, exposure to sunlight, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, estrogen-progesterone therapies, thyroid dysfunction, cosmetics, and drugs have been proposed. Centro-facial, malar, and mandibular are well-recognized. Epidermal pigmentation appears brown/black, while dermal is blue in color, and can be distinguished by Wood's lamp illumination. The difference may be inapparent with mixed type of melasma in skin types V and VI. An increase in melanin in epidermis: basal and suprabasal layers and/or dermis is the prime defect. There is an increased expression of tyrosinase related protein-1 involved in eumelanin synthesis. The use of broad-spectrum sunscreen is important, lightening agents like retinoic acid (tretinoin), azelaic acid, and combination therapies containing hydroquinone, tretinoin, and corticosteroids, have been used in the treatment of melasma, and are thought to have increased efficacy as compared with monotherapy.

True,dizziness nausea nin unsteadiness also depended nicotine dosage nicotine blood concentration better predictor temporal dependence nystagmus nicotine dosagenan,17990061,nicotine,NIN/nystagmus,"Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."
False,addition excess calcium reversed depression tissues calcium independent catecholamine release acetaldehyde blocked nhacnan,6323692,calcium,depression,"Pretreatment with ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) (6 mmol/kg s.c.) approximately doubled the time morphine-treated mice remained on a hot surface and similarly increased muscular incoordination by diazepam, but NH4Ac treatment alone had no effect. Thus, hyperammonemia is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with liver disease. Experiments in vitro showed that acetylcholine-induced catecholamine release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50% by 0.3 mM NH4Ac and KCl-induced contractions of guinea-pig ileum were inhibited 20% by 5 mM NH4Ac. Addition of excess calcium reversed the depression in both tissues, but calcium-independent catecholamine release by acetaldehyde was not blocked by NH4Ac. These results suggested that ammonia blocks calcium channels. Parallels in the actions of NH4Ac and the calcium channel blocker verapamil support this concept. Both verapamil (10 mg/kg i.p.) and NH4Ac pretreatment enhanced morphine analgesia- and diazepam-induced muscular incoordination and antagonized amphetamine-induced motor activity, and neither verapamil nor NH4Ac affected the convulsant action of metrazol. The data suggest that hyperammonemia exerts a calcium channel blocking action which enhances the effects of central nervous system depressants and certain opioid analgesics."

True,curcumin phenolic compound isolated plant curcuma longa linn ingested every day indian subcontinent well reported possess cancerpreventive activity nan,20606042,Curcumin,cancer-preventive activity,"Curcumin, a phenolic compound isolated from the plant Curcuma longa (Linn), is ingested every day in the Indian subcontinent and is well reported to possess cancer-preventive activity. To achieve effective cancer prevention with curcumin, we need to find a new method to enhance the effects of curcumin in the diet. Based on our evidence that (-)-epicatechin (EC), an inert catechin, enhances the cancer-preventive activity of green tea catechins, we studied the enhancing effects of EC on inductions of growth inhibition and apoptosis in human lung cancer cell lines PC-9 and A549 with curcumin. The combination of curcumin with EC significantly increased the inhibition of cell growth compared with curcumin or EC alone. The combination similarly increased both apoptosis and expression of GADD153 and GADD45 genes, associated with their enhanced protein production. Knockdown of GADD153 or GADD45 by small interfering RNA abrogated the apoptosis induction and growth inhibition induced by the combination, indicating the crucial role of their upregulation. Treatments of PC-9 cells with c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase inhibitor SP600125, with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB202190 and with PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 inhibitor) all increased the upregulation of GADD153 and GADD45 genes by the combination. Because EC was previously shown to enhance the incorporation of EGCG into PC-9 cells, we think that EC has similar effects on curcumin. This report is the first report on the enhancing effects of EC on curcumin, and the data suggest that EC plays a significant role in the enhancement of the cancer-preventive activity of curcumin in the diet."
True,ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathologynan,20727411,Ketamine,psychosis,"The glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Administered to healthy volunteers, a subanesthetic dose of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia, ketamine exacerbates the core symptoms of illness, supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysfunction. In a counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind study design, healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic S-ketamine infusion while differences in BOLD responses measured with fMRI were detected. During the scanning period, subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks (phonological, lexical and semantic). Ketamine-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology. Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and ketamine for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected. Ketamine led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency. Ketamine induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an NMDA receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."
True,although firstgeneration vinca alkaloids vincristine associated severe mixed sensorymotor neuropathy deficits associated newer agents class eg vinflunine generally milder limited distal sensory signs symptomsnan,18567992,vincristine,sensory/motor neuropathy,"Microtubule inhibitor (MTI)-based chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer--including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones--are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone."
True,report describe case furosemide identified probable cause druginduced thrombocytopenia yearold man chronic symptomatic idiopathic thrombocytopenia seven years discoverynan,23625769,furosemide,thrombocytopenia,"Immune thrombocytopenia has been attributed to many causes. Several drugs have been implicated as culprits in causing drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Although the mechanism for this type of thrombocytopenia is not well understood, at least three types of antibodies appear to be involved: drug-dependent antibodies, hapten-dependent antibodies, and drug-induced platelet-reactive autoantibodies. In this report, we describe a case in which furosemide was identified as the probable cause of drug-induced thrombocytopenia in an 84-year-old man with chronic symptomatic idiopathic thrombocytopenia for seven years before discovery. The patient's platelet count and daily furosemide dose, both intravenous and oral, were documented throughout his medical history. A dose-dependent change in platelet count was observed in association with the furosemide dose. His platelet count increased on discontinuation of furosemide and beginning of torsemide. Several months after discontinuation of furosemide, his platelet count increased to a 9-year high of 206 × 10³/mm³ from a low of 36 × 10³/mm³ while receiving furosemide therapy. Based on the observations of this case report, clinicians should more readily consider furosemide as a potential cause of thrombocytopenia."

Twelve women meeting prospective, DSM-IV criteria for PMDD, five of whom had a history of sexual abuse, participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design study, comparing 2 months of on oral clonidine (0.3 mg/day) with 2 months on active placebo. During the luteal phase that preceded randomization and following each two-month challenge, women were tested for cardiovascular measures at rest and in response to mental stress, and for resting plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations as well as beta1 and beta2-AR responsivity using the isoproterenol sensitivity test. Results revealed that in comparison to placebo, clonidine significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine concentrations, increased both beta1- and beta2-AR responsivity, and reduced resting and stress heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) (p < 0.05) in all PMDD women. With clonidine, sexually abused PMDD women exhibited greater decreases in resting and stress-induced HR (p < 0.01) and stress-induced systolic BP (p < 0.05), while non-abused PMDD women exhibited greater reductions in plasma NE concentration (p = 0.07), and greater increases in beta2-AR responsivity (p < 0.05) than abused PMDD women. These results suggest PMDD women with and without a history of sexual abuse respond differently to a clonidine challenge in measures reflecting autonomic nervous system functioning, indicating that abuse may modify presynaptic alpha2-AR function in PMDD."

The search for ideal additives to local anaesthetic agents to prolong the analgesic effects poses a challenge to the anaesthetists. Neostigmine, an anticholinesterase, presents a novel approach to providing analgesia. Neostigmine, when given intrathecally, inhibits breakdown of an endogenous spinal neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, thereby inducing analgesia. We aimed to determine the analgesic and adverse effects of intrathecal neostigmine combined with hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl."
False,anti proliferative activity elacy cp combination cloretazine vnpm idarubicin gemcitabine irinotecan topotecan human leukemia lymphoma cellsnan,18398748,idarubicin,lymphoma,"This study evaluated combination drug partners for CP-4055, the C18:1(Delta9,trans) unsaturated fatty acid ester of cytarabine in HL-60 and U937 cells. Growth inhibition was assessed by ATP assay and drug interaction by the combination index and three dimensional methods. Synergy was observed in HL-60 cells for simultaneous combinations of CP-4055 with gemcitabine, irinotecan and topotecan, while combinations with cloretazine (VNP40101M) and idarubicin were additive. In U937 cells, synergy was observed with gemcitabine and additivity for the other drugs. In HL-60, the IC50 concentration of CP-4055 could be reduced 10-fold and that of gemcitabine 3-fold in combination versus the agents alone, an interaction that was independent of drug sequence, ratio and exposure time. In contrast, interactions of CP-4055 with the topoisomerase inhibitors became antagonistic when the drugs were administered 24 h prior to CP-4055 and at certain drug ratios, particularly in U937 cells. In summary, CP-4055 produced additive to synergistic anti proliferative activity when combined simultaneously with drugs from four mechanistic classes in cell culture models of human leukemia and lymphoma. The impact of drug sequence and ratio on the interactions argues for incorporation of these parameters into the design of combination chemotherapy regimens."

True,cumulative doses levobupivacaine ropivacaine produced seizures similar larger bupivacainenan,11524350,ropivacaine,seizures,"We compared the systemic toxicity of bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine in anesthetized rats. We also compared the ability to resuscitate rats after lethal doses of these local anesthetics. Bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, or ropivacaine was infused at a rate of 2 mg. kg(-1). min(-1) while electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and arterial pressure were continuously monitored. When asystole was recorded, drug infusion was stopped and a resuscitation sequence was begun. Epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg was administered at 1-min intervals while external cardiac compressions were applied. Resuscitation was considered successful when a systolic arterial pressure > or =100 mm Hg was achieved within 5 min. The cumulative doses of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine that produced seizures were similar and were larger than those of bupivacaine. The cumulative doses of levobupivacaine that produced dysrhythmias and asystole were smaller than the corresponding doses of ropivacaine, but they were larger than those of bupivacaine. The number of successful resuscitations did not differ among groups. However, a smaller dose of epinephrine was required in the Ropivacaine group than in the other groups. We conclude that the systemic toxicity of levobupivacaine is intermediate between that of ropivacaine and bupivacaine when administered at the same rate and that ropivacaine-induced cardiac arrest appears to be more susceptible to treatment than that induced by bupivacaine or levobupivacaine."

True,randomised clinical trials observational studies shown increased risk myocardial infarction stroke hypertension heart failure treatment cyclooxygenase inhibitors nan,16586083,cyclooxygenase inhibitors,hypertension,"Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with concomitant risk factors. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal, vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time. A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance-specific differences, which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin-independent effects. Diagnostic markers such as N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or high-sensitive C-reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity."

Guidelines suggest that genetic tests are possible only for individuals from families in which the mutations are known. The aim of this study was to provide functional data that establish a potential link between this new variant and susceptibility to MH, and thus enable application in genetic tests."

Prolongation of QT interval, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents, but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem, an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for hypertension. The patient was in near syncope and had QT-interval prolongation. After discontinuing cisapride, the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur. We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, including diltiazem."

False,metformin prevents experimental gentamicininduced nephropathy mitochondriadependent pathwaynan,20164825,Metformin,nephropathy,"The antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular dysfunction even in nondiabetic patients. Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin toxicity. Mitochondrial analysis, respiration intensity, levels of reactive oxygen species, permeability transition, and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after gentamicin administration. Metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin-mediated acute renal failure. This was accompanied by a lower activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems. Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration. These in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function. We found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components (cytochrome c, NADH), probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores. These injuries, partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain, were significantly decreased by metformin. Thus, our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can lessen gentamicin nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis."
False,primary aim study clarify efficacy opioid rotation morphine fentanyl symptom palliation morphineinduced deliriumnan,16043013,fentanyl,opioid rotation,"Although recent studies suggest that opioid rotation could be an effective treatment strategy for morphine-induced delirium, there have been no prospective studies to investigate the treatment effects of opioid rotation using fentanyl. The primary aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in symptom palliation of morphine-induced delirium. Twenty-one consecutive cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium underwent opioid rotation to fentanyl. Physicians recorded the symptom severity of delirium (the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, MDAS), pain, and other symptoms (categorical verbal scale from 0: none to 3: severe) and the Schedule for Team Assessment Scale (STAS) (from 0: none to 4: extreme); and performance status at the time of study enrollment and three and seven days after. Of 21 patients recruited, one patient did not complete the study. In the remaining 20 patients, morphine was substituted with transdermal fentanyl in 9 patients and parenteral fentanyl in 11 patients. Total opioid dose increased from 64 mg oral morphine equivalent/day (Day 0) to 98 mg/day (Day 7), and the median increase in total opioid dose was 42%. Treatment success, defined as an MDAS score below 10 and pain score of 2 or less, was obtained in 13 patients on Day 3 and 18 patients on Day 7. The mean MDAS score significantly decreased from 14 (Day 0) to 6.4 and 3.6 (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Pain scores significantly decreased from 2.2 (Day 0) to 1.3 and 1.1 on the categorical verbal scale (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001); from 2.6 (Day 0) to 1.6 and 1.3 on the STAS (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Symptom scores of dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting significantly decreased, and performance status significantly improved. Opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl may be effective in alleviating delirium and pain in cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium."

In the current study, we sought to confirm the preliminary observations in HES as well as evaluate the therapeutic value of imatinib in eos-CMD that is not associated with t(5;12)(q33;p13). Five patients with HES (all men, median age = 46 years) and 2 with eos-CMD (both men, aged 45 and 58 years) were treated with imatinib at a starting dose of 100 to 400 mg/day. Cytogenetic studies showed no evidence of either the bcr-abl translocation or t(5;12)(q33;p13) in any patient. Screening of exons encoding the intracellular catalytic domains and extracellular ligand binding domains of PDGFR beta (exons 2-23) and c-kit (exons 1-21) in 6 patients demonstrated mostly previously known polymorphisms. At a median follow-up of 17 weeks (range, 10-33 weeks), 2 patients with HES and 1 with eos-CMD have achieved complete clinical remission and 1 additional patient with HES has achieved a partial remission. In contrast to previous observations, all 4 responding patients had elevated serum interleukin-5 levels. Although the drug was well tolerated in most patients, a previously unrecognized treatment toxicity of acute left ventricular dysfunction occurred in a responding patient with HES within the first week of treatment. Myocardial biopsy revealed eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation, and the cardiogenic shock was reversed with the prompt institution of corticosteroid therapy."

False,results suggested curcumin inhibited growth ags cells induced apoptosis activation raserk signaling pathway downstream caspase cascade curcumin might potential target treatment gastric carcinomanan,25492214,curcumin,AGS,"Curcumin, the biologically active compound from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, could inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in gastric carcinoma. However, the underlying mechanism of curcumin on gastric carcinoma cells still needs further investigation. In this study, morphological observation indicated that curcumin inhibited the proliferation of AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner. According to the flow cytometric analysis, curcumin treatment resulted in G2/M arrest in AGS cells, accompanied with an increased expression of cyclin B1 and a decreased expression of cyclin D1. In addition, DNA ladders were observed by gel electrophoresis. Meanwhile, the activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9 were also enhanced in curcumin-treated AGS cells. Nevertheless, the increased activities could be inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OME)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), which suggested that the apoptosis was caspase-dependent. Furthermore, downregulation of rat sarcoma (Ras) and upregulation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were also observed in AGS cells treated with curcumin by Western blot. U0126, an ERK inhibitor, blocked curcumin-induced apoptosis. The results suggested that curcumin inhibited the growth of the AGS cells and induced apoptosis through the activation of Ras/ERK signaling pathway and downstream caspase cascade, and curcumin might be a potential target for the treatment of gastric carcinoma.

Toxicity was higher in the rapid infusion group than it was in the slow infusion group (mean total 7-day chill score, 173 +/- 276 versus 20 +/- 30 [P less than 0.01]; mean total 7-day dosage of meperidine required to abate rigors, 180 +/- 133 versus 58 +/- 78 mg [P less than 0.05]; and mean maximum total 7-day pulse rise, 225 +/- 64 versus 135 +/- 56 beats per min [P less than 0.02], respectively). When analyzed on a daily basis, the mean chill score, meperidine dosage, and pulse rise were also higher; and in addition, nausea and vomiting (5 of 11 patients who received a rapid infusion versus 0 of 9 patients who received a slow infusion [P less than 0.01]) appeared to be more common in those who received amphotericin B rapidly. The daily analysis approach proved that tolerance to these side effects developed with each subsequent infusion day, and by day 7 the incidence and severity were the same. This development of tolerance was significant for the mean chill score in the rapid infusion group (P less than 0.05) and for the proportion of patients with chills (P less than 0.005 for the slow infusion group; P less than 0.05 for the rapid infusion group). A decrease in creatinine clearance to greater than 51% of the baseline value was seen in two patients in each group. There were five deaths (four in the rapid infusion group, 1 in the slow infusion group) within 1 month, but none was clearly related to the amphotericin B infusion. The mean time to defervescence was similar for each group (10.8 +/- 4.1 days in the slow infusion group versus 9.9 +/- 5 days in the rapid infusion group). A rapid infusion regimen for amphotericin B cannot be recommended, at least during the first 5 to 7 days of treatment."

On the basis of this interaction with both endogenous and synthetic substances, glutathione and the key enzyme for its conjugation, glutathione S-transferase, appear to be critical determinants in tumor cell resistance to several antineoplastic drugs, e.g. platinum analogs. In ten established head and neck cancer cell lines (UM-SCC 10A, 10B, 11B, 14A, 14B, 14C, and 22B, HLac79, 8029NA, and 8029DDP4) chemosensitivity to cisplatin, carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and bleomycin, as well as cellular glutathione content and activity of glutathione S-transferase were determined. The results revealed no correlation between the sensitivity of tumor cells to any of the drugs tested and the level of glutathione or the activity of glutathione S-transferase. However, the cisplatin-resistant subpopulation 8029DDP4 showed the highest glutathione level and marked cross-resistance to bleomycin. Glutathione depletion with buthionine sulfoximine led to moderately increased sensitivity towards cisplatin and carboplatin in all cell lines, but did not affect their response to 5-fluorouracil or bleomycin. These results suggest that the level of glutathione or the activity of glutathione S-transferase is not a suitable parameter for the assessment of chemosensitivity in head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma lines. However, response to platinum analogs is influenced by alterations of the initial intracellular glutathione concentration."
False,molecular mechanism regulation glutathione synthesis tumor necrosis factoralpha dexamethasone human alveolar epithelial cellsnan,9988757,glutathione,necrosis,"Glutathione (GSH) is an important physiological antioxidant in lung epithelial cells and lung lining fluid. We studied the regulation of GSH synthesis in response to the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549). TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml) exposure increased GSH levels, concomitant with a significant increase in gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) activity and the expression of gamma-GCS heavy subunit (gamma-GCS-HS) mRNA at 24 h. Treatment with TNF-alpha also increased chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity of a gamma-GCS-HS 5'-flanking region reporter construct, transfected into alveolar epithelial cells. Mutation of the putative proximal AP-1-binding site (-269 to -263 base pairs), abolished TNF-alpha-mediated activation of the promoter. Gel shift and supershift analysis showed that TNF-alpha increased AP-1 DNA binding which was predominantly formed by dimers of c-Jun. Dexamethasone (3 microM) produced a significant decrease in the levels of GSH, decreased gamma-GCS activity and gamma-GCS-HS mRNA expression at 24 h. The increase in GSH levels, gamma-GCS-HS mRNA, gamma-GCS-HS promoter activity, and AP-1 DNA binding produced by TNF-alpha were abrogated by co-treating the cells with dexamethasone. Thus these data demonstrate that TNF-alpha and dexamethasone modulate GSH levels and gamma-GCS-HS mRNA expression by their effects on AP-1 (c-Jun homodimer). These data have implications for the oxidant/antioxidant balance in inflammatory lung diseases."

Chronic pulmonary sequelae in response to silicone injection have not been previously described. We report a case of chronic progressive granulomatous pneumonitis in response to subcutaneous silicone injections in a transgender male-to-female patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). After receiving silicone injections to the buttock, the patient developed rapid onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and chills. Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse peripheral interstitial opacities. She responded symptomatically to prednisone with subsequent intermittent symptomatic flares. Four years later, she developed marked dyspnea and cough. Chest computed tomography showed progressive diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities. Lung biopsies demonstrated numerous spheroid silicone particles within the lung interstitium and small pulmonary vessels, surrounded by foreign body giant cells and nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation. We speculate that HIV-1-infected patients may be at risk for chronic, progressive granulomatous pneumonitis due to silicone injection years after their procedure owing to shifting levels of cell-mediated immunity."

Acetaminophen-poisoned cats develop methemoglobinemia and sometimes hepatic failure. To determine the benefit of using methylene blue, a treatment for methemoglobinemia, along with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the recommended treatment for acetaminophen-poisoned cats, groups of 3 male and 3 female cats each were given methylene blue NAC, or both after administration of acetaminophen (120 mg/kg of body weight, PO). Male cats seemed more susceptible than female cats to acetaminophen toxicosis, because 3 males died of hepatic failure (2 cats given acetaminophen/methylene blue and 1 given acetaminophen/NAC/methylene blue). Although NAC alone seemed to elicit the best overall response, methylene blue, alone or in combination with NAC, may be useful in female cats."

We herein present a case of PRES that occurred after 33 days of high-dose bortezomib treatment and propose both overwhelmed cerebral autoregulation and toxin-mediated blood-brain barrier damage as the underlying mechanisms based on the imaging findings. A favorable recovery was observed two days after achieving stringent hypertension control and withholding bortezomib. Follow-up images obtained two weeks later unveiled a dramatic remission, with faint areas of subcortical hyperintensity in the bilateral parieto-occipital regions. With explicit clinical and imaging features, this case highlights the need for early recognition of PRES during the clinical course of bortezomib therapy. "

Twenty-four visually asymptomatic children underwent a clinical ophthalmological examination, perimetry when appropriate, and VEP and ERG. Thirteen patients had at least one abnormal study. VFC was seen in 11 of 17 patients who had perimetry; 5 of 15 patients who underwent VEP testing and 4 of 11 who underwent ERG testing had abnormal examinations. For the most part, abnormal VEPs and ERGs were found in children who also had VFC. There was a consistent trend for longer treatment periods to correlate with VFC, abnormal ERGs, and VEPs. In summary, over half of the children treated with vigabatrin demonstrated VFC or abnormal ocular electrophysiological studies. Perimetry seemed to be the most sensitive modality for identifying vigabatrin toxicity. Abnormal ERGs and VEPs were primarily seen in children with VFC and may be useful in monitoring children who are not appropriate candidates for perimetry. Although the incidence of vigabatrin-induced VFC is worrisome, in the context of intractable seizures or infantile spasms, therapeutic benefits must be weighed against risks."

In the present case, complete atrioventricular (AV) block with syncopal attacks developed secondary to lithium therapy, necessitating permanent pacemaker implantation. Serum lithium levels remained under or within the therapeutic range during the syncopal attacks. Lithium should be used with extreme caution, especially in patients with mild disturbance of AV conduction."

True,knockdown mir restored mkp expression attenuated cisplatin induced jnk activation cytotoxicity nan,24675421,cisplatin,cytotoxicity,"The elucidation of chemoresistance mechanisms is important to improve cancer patient survival. In this report, we investigated the role and mechanism through which receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), a mediator in cell survival and death signaling, participates in cancer's response to chemotherapy. In lung cancer cells, knockdown of RIP1 substantially increased cisplatin-induced apoptotic cytotoxicity, which was associated with robust JNK activation. The expression of the JNK inactivating phosphatase, MKP1, was substantially reduced in RIP1 knockdown cells. Although MKP1 protein stability was not altered by RIP1 suppression, the synthesis rate of MKP1 was dramatically reduced in RIP1-suppressed cells. Furthermore, we found that the expression of miR-940 was substantially increased in RIP1 knockdown cells. Knockdown of miR-940 restored MKP1 expression and attenuated cisplatin-induced JNK activation and cytotoxicity. Importantly, ectopic expression of MKP1 effectively attenuated cisplatin-induced JNK activation and cytotoxicity. In addition, activation of the JNK upstream signaling kinase, MKK4, was also potentiated in RIP1 knockdown cells. Altogether, our results suggest that RIP1 contributes to cisplatin resistance by suppressing JNK activation that involves releasing miR-940-mediated inhibition of MKP1 and suppressing activation of MKK4. Intervention targeting the RIP1/miR-940/MKP1/JNK pathway may be used to sensitize platinum-based chemotherapy. "

False,cpt-11 produced statistically significant cyclophosphamide procarbazine melphalan growth delays ranging days med days several tumor linesnan,8996518,cyclophosphamide,tumor,"Therapy of patients with malignant central nervous system tumors is frequently unsuccessful, reflecting limitations of current surgical, radiotherapeutic, and pharmacotherapeutic treatments. The camptothecin derivative irinotecan (CPT-11) has been shown to possess antitumor activity in phase II trials for patients with carcinoma of the lung, cervix, ovary, colon, or rectum and for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The current study was designed to test the efficacy of the drug against a panel of human tumor xenografts derived from adult and pediatric central nervous system malignancies. Tumors included childhood high-grade gliomas (D-212 MG, D-456 MG), adult high-grade gliomas (D-54 MG, D-245 MG), medulloblastomas (D341 Med, D487 Med), ependymomas (D528 EP, D612 EP), and a rhabdomyosarcoma (TE-671), as well as sublines with demonstrated resistance to busulfan (D-456 MG (BR)), cyclophosphamide (TE-671 CR), procarbazine (D-245 MG (PR)) or melphalan (TE-671 MR), growing subcutaneously and intracranially in athymic nude mice. In replicate experiments, CPT-11 was given at a dosage of 40 mg/kg per dose via intraperitoneal injection in 10% dimethylsulfoxide on days 1-5 and 8-12, which is the dosage lethal to 10% of treated animals. CPT-11 produced statistically significant (P < 0.001) growth delays in all subcutaneous xenografts tested, including those resistant to busulfan, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, and melphalan, with growth delays ranging from 21.3 days in D487 Med to 90+ days in several tumor lines. Further, tumor regression was evident in every treated animal bearing a subcutaneous tumor, with some xenografts yielding complete tumor regression. Statistically significant (P < 0.001) increases in survival were demonstrated in the two intracranial xenografts-D341 EP (73.0% increase) and D-456 MG (114.2% increase)-treated with CPT-11. These studies demonstrate that, of over 40 drugs evaluated in this laboratory, CPT-11 is the most active against central nervous system xenografts and should be advanced to clinical trial as soon as possible."

It has demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile, with low incidence of myelosuppression. Vinorelbine, a third generation vinca alkaloid, works by inhibiting mitosis and interfering with cells' ability to synthesize DNA and RNA. The present study investigates the therapeutic value of single use capecitabine on solid tumour tissues in vitro using breast cancer cell lines and as reference. The data is to be compared with the use of vinorelbine which is a conventionally applied drug for advanced breast cancer patients."
False,microtubule inhibitor mtibased chemotherapies used treatment breast cancer including vinca alkaloids taxanes epothilonesare known associated peripheral neuropathynan,18567992,vinca alkaloids,breast cancer,"Microtubule inhibitor (MTI)-based chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer--including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones--are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone."
False,although optimal chemotherapy regimen combinedmodality treatment yet established use cisplatin etoposide combinations promote pulmonary cardiac esophageal toxicity particularly appropriate patients smallcell lung cancernan,8380135,cisplatin,toxicity,"Recent approaches to the treatment of limited small-cell lung cancer have combined local radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy in an attempt to improve local control and inhibit distant metastases. Local control is a key indicator of the efficacy of radiotherapy administration in combined-modality regimens. However, even in combined-modality trials using high total radiotherapy doses, local failure rates have ranged from 30 to 50 percent. The components of radiotherapy administration--including dose, volume, fractionation, integration with chemotherapy (concurrent, alternating, or sequential), and timing (early or late administration)--are also important considerations. Hyperfractionation, or the administration of small fractions of radiation more than once daily (usually twice), and accelerated hyperfactionation, or the administration of three fourths of the standard radiation dose two to three times daily, have emerged as important concepts in radiotherapy. Although the optimal chemotherapy regimen for combined-modality treatment has not yet been established, use of cisplatin and etoposide combinations, which do not promote pulmonary, cardiac, or esophageal toxicity, have been particularly appropriate in patients with small-cell lung cancer."
True,thrombophlebitis occurred infusion peripheral cannulae nephrotoxicity ototoxicity confined patients receiving aminoglycoside plus vancomycin nan,3934126,vancomycin,ototoxicity,"A prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of vancomycin was conducted in 54 consecutive patients over a 16-month period. Vancomycin was curative in 95% of 43 patients with proven infection. Drugs were ceased in six patients because of adverse reactions; in three of these vancomycin was considered the likely cause. Reactions included thrombophlebitis (20 of 54 patients), rash (4 of 54), nephrotoxicity (4 of 50), proteinuria (1 of 50) and ototoxicity (1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry). Thrombophlebitis occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae; nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were confined to patients receiving an aminoglycoside plus vancomycin. We conclude that vancomycin, administered appropriately, constitutes safe, effective therapy for infections caused by susceptible bacteria."
True,hiv infection concurrent methamphetamine abuse results exacerbated neurodegenerative changes rapid progression form subcortical dementia termed hiv associated dementianan,17504172,methamphetamine,dementia,"HIV-1 infection with concurrent methamphetamine (MA) abuse results in exacerbated neurodegenerative changes and rapid progression of a form of sub-cortical dementia termed HIV-1 associated dementia (HAD). A notable feature of HAD is the involvement of the dopaminergic system manifested as parkinsonian like movement abnormalities. The HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein is very often used in experimental studies trying to understand neurotoxic consequences of HIV-1 infection, since the pathophysiological changes induced by Tat mirrors, in part, the means by which HIV-1 infection of the nervous system results in neuronal damage. Understanding the interaction of Tat and MA in the basal ganglia and the resultant injury to the dopaminergic system in rodent models as well as cell culture will shed light on the dopaminergic pathology occurring in HIV-1 infected-MA abusers. The aim of this review is to update the reader on the current knowledge of MA and HIV-1 neurotoxicity, specifically Tat, and discuss the progress in understanding how MA synergizes with the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat to damage the basal ganglia."

False,maximum androgen blockade advanced prostate cancer overview randomised trials deaths patientsnan,7630245,androgen,prostate cancer,"A systematic overview, or meta-analysis, of the randomised evidence on maximum androgen blockade (MAB) in advanced prostate cancer identified 25 trials that compared conventional castration (surgical or medical) versus MAB (castration plus prolonged use of an antiandrogen such as flutamide, cyproterone acetate, or nilutamide). Individual patient data were obtained from 22 of the trials. Median follow-up was 40 months, during which 57% of patients died (3283/5710). Crude mortality rates were 58% for castration alone and 56% for MAB. Life-table estimates of the corresponding 5-year survival rates were 22.8% and 26.2%, representing a non-significant improvement of 3.5% (95% CI 0-7%). Logrank time-to-death analyses found no significant heterogeneity between trials (or between the effects of different types of MAB) and no significant evidence of additional benefit in an overview of all these MAB trial results (2p > 0.1). The currently available evidence from randomised trials does not show that MAB results in longer survival than conventional castration."
True,investigated whether endothelial cells infected sinv differentially responsive bradykinin bk potent inducer inflammatory edema broad range infectious diseases nan,22047990,bradykinin,infectious diseases,"Sindbis virus (SINV) induces inflammatory and vasoactive responses that are associated with rash and arthritis in human infections. The mechanisms underlying infection-associated microvasculopathy are still unknown. We investigated whether endothelial cells infected by SINV are differentially responsive to bradykinin (BK), a potent inducer of inflammatory edema in a broad range of infectious diseases. Human endothelial cells (HBMECs) infected with SINV presented an upregulation of bradykinin B2 receptors (BK2R) expression. Also, BK reduced SINV-induced apoptosis and enhanced virus replication in HBMECs in a way dependent on BK2R, PI3 kinase and ERK signaling. Strikingly, intracerebral infection of mice in the presence of a BK2R antagonist reduced the local viral load. Our data suggest that SINV infection renders human endothelial cells hypersensitive to BK, which increases host cell survival and viral replication. Ongoing studies may clarify if the deregulation of the kinin pathway contributes to infection-associated vasculopathies in life-threatening arbovirus infections."
True,binding nicotine nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nachrs elicits series dosedependent behaviors go altered exploration sedation tremors seizures deathacetylcholine part nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nicotine binding receptors causes tremors acetylcholinenicotinic acetylcholine receptors acetylcholine,15275829,acetylcholine,tremors,"Binding of nicotine to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) elicits a series of dose-dependent behaviors that go from altered exploration, sedation, and tremors, to seizures and death. nAChRs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits. A gene cluster comprises the alpha3, alpha5 and beta4 subunits, which coassemble to form functional receptors. We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion in beta4 homozygous null (beta4 -/-) and alpha3 heterozygous (+/-) mice. beta4 -/- mice were less sensitive to the effects of nicotine both at low doses, measured as decreased exploration in an open field, and at high doses, measured as sensitivity to nicotine-induced seizures. Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits, we showed that alpha5 mRNA levels are unchanged, whereas alpha3 mRNA levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 -/- brains. alpha3 +/- mice were partially resistant to nicotine-induced seizures when compared to wild-type littermates. mRNA levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 +/- brains. Together, these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion."

True,rings intact endothelium htlikeselective agonist sumatriptan caused small contractions log ec intrinsic activity respect 5-ht resistant blockade nm ketanserin antagonized nm methiothepinnan,8789380,sumatriptan,contractions,"1. We investigated the hypothesis that, as in some other large human arteries, 5-HT-induced contraction of the temporal artery is mediated through two co-existing receptor populations, 5-HT1-like- and 5-HT2A. Temporal arterial segments were obtained from patients undergoing brain surgery and rings prepared set up to contract with 5-HT and related agents. Fractions of maximal 5-HT responses mediated through 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2A receptors, f1 and f2 = 1-f1, were estimated by use of the 5-HT2A-selective antagonist ketanserin. 2. In rings with intact endothelium 5-HT evoked contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.0. Ketanserin (10-1000 nM) antagonized part of the 5-HT-induced contractions. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M of 6.9 and f1 of 0.17 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 6.4 and f1 of 0.20 (1000 nM ketanserin). 3. In rings with endothelial function attenuated by enzymatic treatment, 5-HT caused contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.2 that were partially blocked by ketanserin. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M 7.4 and f1 of 0.16 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 7.5 and f1 of 0.14 (1000 nM ketanserin). 4. The ketanserin-resistant component of 5-HT-evoked contraction was blocked by methiothepin (100-1000 nM) consistent with mediation through 5-HT1-like receptors. 5. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT1-like-selective agonist, sumatriptan, caused small contractions with a -log EC50, M of 6.5 and intrinsic activity of 0.21 with respect to 5-HT that were resistant to blockade by 1000 nM ketanserin but antagonized by 100 nM methiothepin. 6. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT2A receptor partial agonist SK&F 103829 (2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-8[methyl sulphonyl]-1H3-benzazepin-7-ol methensulphonate) contracted rings with a -log EC50, M of 5.0 and an intrinsic activity of 0.49 with respect to 5-HT; the effects were antagonized by ketanserin 1000 nM. 7. We conclude that 80-86% of the maximum 5-HT-evoked contraction of human temporal artery is mediated through 5-HT2A receptors, the remainder through 5-HT1-like-receptors, regardless of whether or not endothelium is functional. The 5-HT1-like-receptors are more likely to be 5-HT1D beta receptors than 5-HT1D alpha receptors and sumatriptan is a full agonist for these receptors. As found in arteries of other species, SK&F 103829 is a partial agonist for 5-HT2A receptors of human temporal artery."

True,addition muscle damage severe damage also seen harderian glands especially exposure mepivacaine lidocaine plus epinephrinenan,4038130,mepivacaine,muscle damage,"Local anesthetics that are commonly used in ophthalmic surgery (0.75% bupivacaine hydrochloride, 2.0% mepivacaine hydrochloride, and 2.0% lidocaine hydrochloride plus 1:100,000 epinephrine) were injected into the retrobulbar area of rat eyes. Controls were injected with physiological saline. All three anesthetics produced massive degeneration of the extraocular muscles. Muscle degeneration is followed by regeneration of the damaged muscle fibers. In addition to muscle damage, severe damage was also seen in harderian glands, especially after exposure to mepivacaine and lidocaine plus epinephrine. With these findings in rats, it is hypothesized that the temporary diplopia sometimes seen in patients after ophthalmic surgery might be due to anesthetic-induced damage to the extraocular muscles."
True,present study suggests tianeptine tricyclic antidepressant endowed less cardiac toxicity classical tricyclic antidepressantsnan,2306747,tianeptine,cardiac toxicity,"In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, the effects of therapeutic doses of the new tricyclic antidepressant tianeptine on cardiovascular function were closely monitored in 21 healthy volunteers during a 2-week treatment period. Blood pressure measurements, ECG recording, 24-h Holter monitoring, and echocardiography were carried out at 1-week intervals. Isotopic ventriculography was measured twice under each treatment. Tianeptine did not produce orthostatic hypotension or increase heart rate. No ECG changes could be observed and the cardiac conduction time remained unchanged. One subject presented with an increase in frequency of ventricular premature beats that could not be definitely attributed to the drug. Cardiac output assessed at rest and after a bicycle exercise stress test was not altered. The present study suggests that tianeptine is a tricyclic antidepressant endowed with less cardiac toxicity than classical tricyclic antidepressants."
True,cases normal plasma urinary free cortisol levels achieved following ketoconazole therapy yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated hypertension patient  weeks patient treatmentlongterm patient monitoring showed patients hypertension receiving ketoconazole therapy,2632720,ketoconazole,hypertension,"Two of 14 patients with Cushing's syndrome treated on a long-term basis with ketoconazole developed sustained hypertension. In both cases normal plasma and urinary free cortisol levels had been achieved following ketoconazole therapy, yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated hypertension 31 (patient 1) and 52 weeks (patient 2) after treatment. In patient 1, plasma levels of deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol were elevated. In patient 2, in addition to an increase in both deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol levels, plasma aldosterone values were raised, with a concomitant suppression of renin levels. Our findings show that long-term treatment with high doses of ketoconazole may induce enzyme blockade leading to mineralocorticoid-related hypertension."

Pneumoconiosis, irritant bronchitis, focal emphysema, and carcinoma may be produced by oxidants either directly through lipid peroxidation and protein inactivation, or indirectly by oxidant-mediated release of cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor. The increased incidence of tuberculosis observed among silicate workers could be explained by accumulation of iron complexed by dust particles in the lung and made available to dormant mycobacteria as a virulence factor."
False,patients experience opioidrelated toxicity associated respiratory depression treated immediately opioid antagonist naloxone closely monitored least hoursnan,14583070,naloxone,respiratory depression,"Transdermal fentanyl is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of chronic pain caused by malignancy and non-malignant conditions when administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Compared with oral opioids, the advantages of transdermal fentanyl include a lower incidence and impact of adverse effects (constipation, nausea and vomiting, and daytime drowsiness), a higher degree of patient satisfaction, improved quality of life, improved convenience and compliance resulting from administration every 72 hours, and decreased use of rescue medication. Transdermal fentanyl is a useful analgesic for cancer patients who are unable to swallow or have gastrointestinal problems. Transdermal fentanyl forms a depot within the upper skin layers before entering the microcirculation. Therapeutic blood levels are attained 12-16 hours after patch application and decrease slowly with a half-life of 16-22 hours following removal. Patients with chronic pain should be titrated to adequate relief with short-acting oral or parenteral opioids prior to the initiation of transdermal fentanyl in order to prevent exacerbations of pain or opioid-related adverse effects. Transdermal fentanyl can then be initiated based on the 24-hour opioid requirement once adequate analgesia has been achieved. The prolonged elimination of transdermal fentanyl can become problematic if patients develop opioid-related adverse effects, especially hypoventilation. Adverse effects do not improve immediately after patch removal and may take many hours to resolve. Patients who experience opioid-related toxicity associated with respiratory depression should be treated immediately with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone and closely monitored for at least 24 hours. Because of the short half-life of naloxone, sequential doses or a continuous infusion of the opioid antagonist may be necessary. Transdermal fentanyl should be administered cautiously to patients with pre-existing conditions such as emphysema that may predispose them to the development of hypoventilation. Transdermal fentanyl is indicated only for patients who require continuous opioid administration for the treatment of chronic pain that cannot be managed with other medications. It is contraindicated in the management of acute and postoperative pain, as pain may decrease more rapidly in these circumstances than fentanyl blood levels can be adjusted, leading to the development of life-threatening hypoventilation. Cognitive and physical impairments such as confusion and abnormal co-ordination can occur with transdermal fentanyl. Therefore, patients should be instructed to refrain from driving or operating machinery immediately following the initiation of transdermal fentanyl, or after any dosage increase. Patients may resume such activities once the absence of these potential adverse effects is documented."
True,pinealectomized chick pretreatment dopamine increased duration catatonia doc ketamine pretreatment norepinephrinenan,6540303,dopamine,catatonia,"The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal idolamines on ketamine-induced catatonia in the intact, pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat. In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of catatonia (DOC) after ketamine, but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not. The pineal indolamines exhibited mixed actions. Serotonin and N-acetyl serotonin which augmented ketamine DOC, did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland, whereas melatonin potentiated the ketamine DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick. Ketamine was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent; furthermore, melatonin did not augment the ketamine DOC whereas dopamine continued to do so. This study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the amines on the pineal in spite of the immature blood-brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat. In addition, these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketamine DOC induced by melatonin. Furthermore, dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine catatonia rather than directly on the pituitary."

True,moreover alcohol abuse produce cardiac arrhythmias hypertension cardiomyopathy stroke even sudden deathnan,9751945,alcohol,cardiomyopathy,"The ingestion of one or two alcoholic drinks can affect heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, myocardial contractility, and regional blood flow. These actions generally are not clinically important. In the presence of cardiovascular disease, however, even such small quantities of alcohol might result in transient unfavorable hemodynamic changes. Moreover, alcohol abuse can produce cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, stroke, and even sudden death. In contrast, moderate alcohol use produces changes that have an overall favorable effect on atherosclerotic-related vascular diseases. Because cardiovascular disease due to atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in Western society, this desirable effect of alcohol use outweighs its detrimental actions, resulting in favorable findings in population studies. Nevertheless, the body of evidence argues against encouraging alcohol use for its cardiovascular effects."

Clinical trials to lower blood glucose have been disappointing probably because the participants were too late in the natural history of diabetes and already had extensive vascular disease. Insulin resistance measured simply by elevated fasting blood insulin is an early marker of β-cell stress and peripheral insulin resistance. Metformin will prevent development of diabetes among patients with impaired fasting glucose but only for the short term. Metformin reduces risk of coronary heart disease. The drug is safe, low cost, and may also prevent cancer. The combination of diet and exercise followed by metformin in the early phase of ""insulin resistance"" may reduce or delay both atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis complications associated with diabetes. Preventive therapy must begin much earlier than before clinical diagnosis of diabetes and aim to initially lower blood insulin levels or insulin resistance."

True,chaotic neovascularization induced aggressive fibrosarcoma cells overexpressing s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylasenan,21134486,S-adenosylmethionine,fibrosarcoma,"S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines essential for cell proliferation. Overexpression of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase in rodent fibroblasts led to aggressive transformants (Amdc-s cells) that had unforeseen high invasive capacity in nude mice, invading rapidly from the subcutaneous injection site into the peritoneal cavity and its organs. In vitro, these cells were much more invasive than Ras-oncogene-transformed fibroblasts, or human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. In immunohistological characterization, Amdc-s-induced tumors showed chaotic neovascularization, with abundant pleomorphic vessel-like structures that had noncontiguous or totally missing laminin (basement membrane) and CD31 (endothelial cell) immunoreactivity. Gene expression and protein analyses of Amdc-s cells showed them to overexpress several pro-angiogenic molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), and to exhibit profound down-regulation of the anti-angiogenic thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). By reintroduction of TSP-1 into Amdc-s cells, the high invasiveness was efficiently inhibited in vitro. Interestingly, Amdc-s cells showed up-regulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and also expressed the MET receptor, creating thus an autocrine loop able to regulate VEGF-A and TSP-1 levels. Further, we found Amdc-s cells to express increased amounts of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and the large isoform of tenascin-C (TN-C), which may also contribute to the angiogenic switch and invasiveness. Consequently, Amdc-s cells offer an excellent model to sort out the key molecules of aggressive tumor growth, and thereby help in designing rational, novel anti-vascular and other cancer therapies."

True,mdma polydrug users show processspecific central executive impairments coupled impaired social emotional judgement processes people take mdma drugs develop impaired social emotional judgement processes,16574712,MDMA,impaired social and emotional judgement processes,"In recent years working memory deficits have been reported in users of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy). The current study aimed to assess the impact of MDMA use on three separate central executive processes (set shifting, inhibition and memory updating) and also on ""prefrontal"" mediated social and emotional judgement processes. Fifteen polydrug ecstasy users and 15 polydrug non-ecstasy user controls completed a general drug use questionnaire, the Brixton Spatial Anticipation task (set shifting), Backward Digit Span procedure (memory updating), Inhibition of Return (inhibition), an emotional intelligence scale, the Tromso Social Intelligence Scale and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX). Compared with MDMA-free polydrug controls, MDMA polydrug users showed impairments in set shifting and memory updating, and also in social and emotional judgement processes. The latter two deficits remained significant after controlling for other drug use. These data lend further support to the proposal that cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex may be impaired by recreational ecstasy use."
False,study designed investigate effect delapril ace inhibitor manidipine long action calcium antagonist persistent microalbuminuria normotensive type diabetic patientsnan,11336083,calcium,diabetic,"This study was designed to investigate the effect of delapril, an ACE inhibitor, and manidipine, a long action calcium antagonist, on persistent microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients. Sixty type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to take delapril 30 mg/day or manidipine 10 mg/day for 48 weeks, in an open label design. Twenty eight of thirty subjects in the delapril group and twenty nine of thirty in the manidipine group completed the study. Urine albumin excretion as measured by the urinary albumin creatinine ratio decreased significantly in both groups (112.0+/-60.9 to 95.3+/-64.9 mg/g and 108.5+/-51.0 to 96.4+/-53.5 mg/g in the delapril and manidipine group respectively, p < 0.05, by paired t-test). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly changed after treatment in the delapril group but significantly decreased in the manidipine group (130.9+/-7.1/80.2+/-6.1 to 127.2+/-7.1/78.0+/-5.3 mm/Hg, p < 0.05, by student's paired t-test). After 48 weeks of treatment, two patients in the delapril group and one patient in the manidipine group converted to normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) and one patient in each group progressed to overt nephropathy (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g). There were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, serum fructosamine, creatinine, potassium and lipid profiles after 48 weeks of treatment in both groups. Two cases in the delapril group were withdrawn during the study because of an intolerable cough and one case in the manidipine group because of intolerable dizziness and headache. In conclusion, both delapril and manidipine are effective in the reduction of microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria."

The management of LCH is difficult as these disorders respond inconsistently to immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic strategies. Thalidomide (N-phtalimidoglutarimide), initially used as a tranquilizer, has recently been used in the management of several inflammatory skin diseases. We describe the case of a 38-year-old male with mucocutaneous LCH. A treatment course with 6 cycles of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosin (cladribine) was initiated. This was well tolerated but withdrawn after 6 months to prevent secondary malignancy. A partial remission was seen. Subsequently, a treatment course with thalidomide 200 mg daily was started. This therapy resulted in a significant improvement of the mucocutaneous lesions within 4 weeks and complete healing was achieved after 3 months. Treatment was then successfully continued with daily doses of 100 mg to prevent relapse. In conclusion, thalidomide monotherapy represents an effective, safe and well-tolerated treatment option that should be considered as first-line therapy for mucocutaneous LCH."

True,claimed high correlation positive history nickel hypersensitivity patchtest results testing unnecessary history hypersensitivity nan,2406062,nickel,hypersensitivity,"Several reports indicate that the prevalence of nickel sensitivity among females in the general population is around 10 per cent and probably is increasing, especially in schoolchildren. It has been claimed that there is such a high correlation between a positive history of nickel hypersensitivity and patch-test results that testing is unnecessary if there is a history of hypersensitivity. This is not true. Nickel hypersensitivity itself is not a serious health problem for the individual. However, when hand eczema also is present, the situation is quite different. Concerns about medical metal implants in nickel-sensitive persons appear to have been exaggerated, and nickel intake in food probably is not a serious difficulty, although some persons may be unusually sensitive. In dealing with the clinical problems of nickel dermatitis, we must not overlook prophylaxis. It seems important to introduce safe methods of ear piercing (a primary source of nickel hypersensitivity) and to spread information about the health hazard potential of the seemingly harmless sensitivity to nickel."

True,sixtyyearold woman advanced breast cancer previously treated cisplatin developed irreversible lethal renal failure anuria day gm bolus ifosfamide nan,2320800,ifosfamide,anuria,"A sixty-year-old woman with advanced breast cancer, previously treated with cisplatin, developed an irreversible lethal renal failure with anuria, the day after 5 g/m2 bolus ifosfamide. Postrenal failure was excluded by echography. A prerenal component could have contributed to renal failure because of a transient hypotension, due to an increasing ascitis, occurring just before anuria. However, correction of the hemodynamic parameters did not improve renal function. Ifosfamide is a known nephrotoxic drug with demonstrated tubulopathies. We strongly suspect that this lethal anuria was mainly due to ifosfamide, occurring in a patient having received previous cisplatin chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient hypotension. We recommend careful use of ifosfamide in patients pretreated with nephrotoxic chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion."

False,observations support idea might serve target clozapine significantly modified extended understanding mechanisms underlying atypical antipsychotic treatment schizophrenia well dopamine hypothesis schizophrenia nan,9278187,dopamine,schizophrenia,"For the past 20 years the most enduring explanation for schizophrenia has been the dopamine hypothesis, which proposes that the dopaminergic system is overactive in this widespread disease. Classically, the D2 receptor formed the core of the dopamine hypothesis since there was considerable evidence for elevations of D2 receptor levels in the brains of schizophrenic patients, and because these receptors served as the primary target in mediating antipsychotic effects of most neuroleptics. However, the dopamine D4 receptor has recently received particular attention in this context. This is because the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, which is effective in treating refractory schizophrenics without the side-effect profile of typical neuroleptics, displays a 10-fold higher affinity for D4 compared to D2 or D3 receptors. Furthermore, the concentration in plasma water of clinical doses ofclozapine correlates well with its in vitro binding affinity for D4, but not D2 or D3 receptors, suggesting that D4 is a potential target in mediating clozapine's antipsychotic effects. As well, marked elevations in the level of a D4-like site (not identical to the D4 receptor) has been seen in the striatum of postmortem schizophrenic brains, but not in control brains. Finally, the most interesting feature of the D4 receptor is perhaps the array of polymorphisms associated with it, creating structural diversity in this receptor that supercedes all other known catecholamine receptors. The existence of these D4 polymorphisms raises the possibility that structural variations of this receptor may be associated with an increased susceptibility to schizophrenia, or observed variations in individual response to clozapine treatment. However, several studies aimed at investigating these hypotheses could not establish a direct role of D4 in schizophrenia. Furthermore, no association was evident between the polymorphic forms of D4 and susceptibility to schizophrenia, or variable clozapine response. Nevertheless, investigations surrounding this receptor has been far from futile. The observations which support the idea that D4 might serve as a target for clozapine have significantly modified and extended our understanding of mechanisms underlying atypical antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia, as well as the dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia. Further characterization of this receptor may prove to be crucial in designing highly effective antipsychotic drugs with minimal contraindications."
True,sudden rapid deterioration death rare consequences disseminated cryptococcosis steroids may worsen course diseasenan,10498175,steroids,cryptococcosis,"We report the case of a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) whose death occurred within 30 hours of hospitalization due to disseminated cryptococcosis, manifested by dizziness, cough, and shortness of breath. The clinical picture was consistent with pneumocystis pneumonia, and antibiotic therapy with corticosteroids was initiated. Despite initial improvement, the patient's condition quickly worsened, resulting in cardiorespiratory arrest and death. Autopsy revealed cryptococci in several organs. Sudden, rapid deterioration and death are rare consequences of disseminated cryptococcosis, and steroids may worsen the course of the disease. On the basis of this case and review of similar cases in the literature, we recommend early consideration of disseminated cryptococcosis in AIDS patients with pneumonia. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality."
False,efficacy ccb amlodipine arb valsartan lowering bp protecting cardiovascular events stroke across range hypertensive patient populations established many yearsnan,20626210,amlodipine,hypertensive,"Early initiation of rational and effective combination therapy consisting of antihypertensive drugs with two different and complementary mechanisms of actions is increasingly becoming accepted in clinical practice and by guidelines as a first-line approach to control blood pressure (BP) and prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Once-daily combination therapy provides more rapid control of BP, which is important for preventing cardiovascular events, with similar or improved tolerability compared with the component monotherapies, and improved adherence because of regimen simplification. Combination therapy with a calcium channel antagonist (calcium channel blocker [CCB]) and an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a rational approach to achieve BP goals and provide protection against renal and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A number of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations, including CCB/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and CCB/ angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) combinations are available as fixed-dose formulations. There is substantial evidence for the BP-lowering efficacy of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations in diverse patient populations, and their use in combination is associated with favourable tolerability and fewer adverse metabolic effects than some other combination therapies. Recent evidence from large outcome trials supports the use of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations for reducing the risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly in high-risk patients, together with evidence that the benefits of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations may extend beyond their efficacy in lowering BP in terms of protecting against fatal and nonfatal stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related deaths. The efficacy of the CCB amlodipine and the ARB valsartan in lowering BP and protecting against cardiovascular events and stroke across a range of hypertensive patient populations has been established over many years. Fixed-dose amlodipine/valsartan combinations are available in many countries and have shown greater BP reductions and better BP control than the respective monotherapies in diverse patient populations, together with a favourable tolerability profile. Once-daily amlodipine/valsartan is a rational and convenient treatment option for the effective management of patients with hypertension, improving adherence to antihypertensive medication and protecting against cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality."

True,acute renal failure subsequent administration rifampicin followup study cases reported earliernan,982002,rifampicin,Acute renal failure,"A clinical presentation is made of a 2-3 year follow-up of six cases of acute renal failure that have been reported earlier. The patients had developed transient renal failure after the intermittent administration of rifampicin. The stage of olig-anuria lasted for 1-3 weeks, and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis. Two of the patients died due to unrelated causes during the follow-up period. The four patients re-examined were clinically cured. Pathologic findings by light microscopy and immunofluorescence at biopsy were scarce. Nothing abnormal was seen by electron microscopy in two of the cases studied. Renal function was normal. In three cases the excretion at 131I-hippuran renography was slightly slowed. Although in the acute stage the renal lesions histologically appeared toxic, evidence suggestive of an immunological mechanism cannot be excluded."
False,cytotoxicity due exposure ndma partially inhibited antioxidants n-acetylcysteine ascorbic acid butylated hydroxyanisole n-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone potentiated upon glutathione depletionnan,9498284,N-acetylcysteine,cytotoxicity,"GM0637, a human fibroblast cell line, was transfected with pCMV2E1, an expression vector containing the full length cDNA for rat cytochrome P450 2E1 (P450 2E1), and with pCMVneo, which contained vector alone, and the selected clones were designated GM2E1 and GMneo, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that GM2E1, but not GMneo, expressed a protein that reacted with anti-human P450 2E1 antibody. The 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase,p-nitrophenol hydroxylase, and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) demethylase activities of the P450 in these cells were measured in monolayer cell cultures without preparing microsomes. Exposure of the GM2E1 cells to NDMA for 4 days caused severe decreases in cell viability, as determined by crystal violet uptake, and showed a sigmoidal dose-response curve with a median lethal dose of 17 microM. In contrast, the viability of GMneo cells was not altered by NDMA even at concentrations up to 10 mM. Time- and concentration-dependent methylation of DNA, RNA and protein by [14C]NDMA was only observed in cells expressing P450 2E1. Inhibitors of P450 2E1 activity such as ethanol, 4-methylpyrazole, and isoniazid caused a 90% decrease in the methylation of cellular macromolecules and also completely protected the cells against NDMA-mediated toxicity. The cytotoxicity due to exposure to NDMA was partially inhibited by antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole and N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone but was not potentiated upon glutathione depletion. These results document the ability of rat P450 2E1 to metabolize NDMA to toxic reactive intermediates and demonstrate that this cell line provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of metabolism-mediated toxicity and carcinogenesis."

False,open randomised crossover study investigated effect single mg oral dose entacapone novel catechol omethyltransferase comt inhibitor pharmacokinetics metabolism levodopacarbidopa cardiovascular responses blood pressure pulse rate variation standard stimuli eight parkinsonian patientsnan,8112370,catechol,parkinsonian,"In an open, randomised, cross-over study we investigated the effect of a single 200 mg oral dose of entacapone, a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of levodopa/carbidopa, and on the cardiovascular responses (blood pressure and pulse rate variation to standard stimuli) in eight parkinsonian patients. Entacapone significantly increased the mean area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of levodopa by 46%, from 3620 to 5280 h.ng.ml-1 and prolonged its elimination half-life (t1/2el) from 1.5 h to 2.0 h. The mean AUC of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), the monoamine oxidase-dependent metabolite of levodopa, was significantly increased from 122 to 343 h.micrograms.ml-1 by entacapone. A small decrease in the AUC of homovanillic acid (HVA), the COMT dependent metabolite of levodopa, was observed (from 455 to 303 h.ng.ml-1). Entacapone also decreased the excretion of HVA but not that of 3-methoxytyramine in the urine. Cardiovascular autonomic responses to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli were not changed by entacapone. We conclude that a single dose of entacapone moderately increases the AUC and prolongs the t1/2el of levodopa in man and that that does not affect cardiovascular autonomic regulation."

Intravenous caffeine is commonly used to improve seizure duration and quality in such patients and is generally well tolerated aside from occasional reports of relatively benign ventricular ectopy. We describe a patient with no previous history of cardiac disease or arrhythmia who developed sustained bigeminy and 2 brief runs of ventricular tachycardia after caffeine administration. Although intravenous caffeine is generally well tolerated, the clinician should be aware of the potential for unpredictable and serious ventricular arrhythmias."

True,five fortyfive adult men years age less received least six months medroxyprogesterone acetate mpa depo provera im mgweek prevention sexoffending genitalmutilating behavior developed symptomatic cholelithiasis nan,1385654,medroxyprogesterone acetate/MPA,cholelithiasis,"Five out of forty-five adult men, 50 years of age or less, who had received, for at least six months, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, Depo Provera) IM, 200-400 mg/week, for prevention of sex-offending or genital-mutilating behavior developed symptomatic cholelithiasis. Thirty of these men were studied with gallbladder ultrasound prospectively off MPA and at six-month intervals while taking the medication and then six months off MPA. Gallstones recovered from two patients were found to have very high cholesterol content, suggesting they were formed in cholesterol supersaturated bile. These findings are consistent with the increased incidence of gallbladder disease related to high-progesterone states and suggest that MPA may be a causative agent in cholelithiasis. The physiologic studies on gallbladder contraction and cholecystokinin release in a subset of the patients failed to provide information on a mechanism for the possible increased incidence of gallbladder disease."
True,addition oestrogens play important role breast cancer development oestrone sulphate es might main source active oestrogens breastnan,10823131,oestrone sulphate,breast cancer,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional regulator of cellular growth and differentiation in many cell types and has a growth inhibitory effect on mammary epithelial cells. The TGF-beta 2 isoform has been shown to be present in high concentrations in breast cyst fluid and might have a protective role in breast cancer. In addition, oestrogens play an important role in breast cancer development, and oestrone sulphate (E1S) might be the main source of active oestrogens in the breast. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of TGF-beta 2 on oestrogen synthesis in an attempt to understand the mechanism by which TGF-beta 2 may exert a protective effect in breast cancer. In this study, higher concentrations of TGF-beta 2 significantly inhibited the conversion of E1S to oestrone (E1) and the conversion of E1 to the potent oestrogen, oestradiol (E2). TGF-beta 2 did not have any effect on MCF-7 cell growth or on E2 to E1 conversion. In conclusion, TGF-beta 2 might exert a protective role in breast cancer by reducing the amount of active oestrogens present in the breast."

False,sixtynine percent patients continued treatment amiodarone recurrence symptomatic vt ventricular fibrillation vf followup  months mean standard deviation  nan,6637851,amiodarone,VT,"Amiodarone was administered to 154 patients who had sustained, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 118) or a cardiac arrest (n = 36) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. The loading dose was 800 mg/day for 6 weeks and the maintenance dose was 600 mg/day. Sixty-nine percent of patients continued treatment with amiodarone and had no recurrence of symptomatic VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) over a follow-up of 6 to 52 months (mean +/- standard deviation 14.2 +/- 8.2). Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of VT and were successfully managed by continuing amiodarone at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug. One or more adverse drug reactions occurred in 51% of patients. Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of amiodarone in 41% and discontinuation of amiodarone in 10% of patients. The most common symptomatic adverse reactions were tremor or ataxia (35%), nausea and anorexia (8%), visual halos or blurring (6%), thyroid function abnormalities (6%) and pulmonary interstitial infiltrates (5%). Although large-dose amiodarone is highly effective in the long-term treatment of VT or VF refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, it causes significant toxicity in approximately 50% of patients. However, when the dose is adjusted based on clinical response or the development of adverse effects, 75% of patients with VT or VF can be successfully managed with amiodarone."

True,mechanisms myocardial ischemia induced epinephrine comparison exerciseinduced ischemianan,3413271,epinephrine,myocardial ischemia,"The role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial ischemia was examined in patients with coronary artery disease. Objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise. Both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial ischemia as evidenced by ST segment depression and angina. However, the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exercise. Exercise-induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while epinephrine-induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product. These findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine, as may occur during states of emotional distress, has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion."

True,data suggest naloxone reverses respiratory paralysis produced thiopental involves gaba actionnan,2893236,thiopental,respiratory paralysis,"No agent is yet available to reverse respiratory paralysis produced by CNS depressants, such as general anesthetics. In this study naloxone reversed respiratory paralysis induced by thiopental in rats. 25 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate, increased GABA, decreased glutamate, and had no effect on aspartate or glycine levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem. Pretreatment of rats with thiosemicarbazide for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of thiopental. 50 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced respiratory arrest with further increase in GABA and decrease in glutamate again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the amino acids studied in four regions of rat brain. Naloxone (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) reversed respiratory paralysis, glutamate and GABA levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum. These data suggest naloxone reverses respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental and involves GABA in its action."

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that EPCs have therapeutic potential in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated vascular diseases. In this study, to investigate the effects of oxidative stress on EPCs, EPCs were treated with H2O2 at different final concentrations for 3 h. MTT assay, scratch-wound assay and Matrigel invasion assay revealed that cell proliferation, migration and tubule formation and function, respectively, were impaired under H2O2 stress in a concentration-dependent manner. To determine protein response to H2O2 stress, two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry were performed. The results revealed that triosephosphate isomerase and ADP-sugar pyrophosphatase were downregulated, while peroxiredoxin-2, thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase, mitochondrial (Prx‑3), peroxiredoxin-6, EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, vimentin and Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor α were upregulated in the H2O2-treated EPCs. To further confirm the results from mass spectrometry, the expression pattern of Prx-3 in response to H2O2 stress was examined by western blot analysis. The data presented in this study provide novel insight into the defensive mechanisms of EPCs and the pathways of oxidative damage in an oxidative environment."

Prompted by a case of clozapine-related pericarditis in an adolescent, we undertook a retrospective chart review to discover whether any unrecognized cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy were among the children, adolescents, and young adults we had treated with clozapine. The sample comprised a total of 36 patients, who were monitored regularly over a period ranging from 2.5 to 79 months. The average observation period was 7.5 months. Patients were assessed for potential indicators of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. In more than 66% of all patients, at least one of several parameters potentially indicative of pericarditis, myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy was abnormal in at least one instance during the observation period. In all cases in which abnormalities were discovered, the abnormalities were found to be unspecific for myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. With the exception of the case which prompted our study, none of the patients were found to have developed any such disorder in the course of further treatment with clozapine."

False,three prospective randomized phase iii studies advanced crc oxaliplatin plus 5-fu lv improved significantly progressionfree survival without significant increase median survival time without affecting quality life compared treatment 5-fu lvnan,12398998,5-FU,CRC,"Oxaliplatin, a platinum compound characterized by a diaminocyclohexane (DACH) platinum carrier ligand, has proven its efficacy in first- and second-line advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. Acute reversible and cumulative peripheral sensory neuropathy has been observed frequently with oxaliplatin treatment and limits its use. Its synergism with other drugs, as well as its different mechanism of action and toxicity profile make it an attractive candidate for combination studies in CRC. It can be combined safely with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)+/-folinic acid (LV), irinotecan, raltitrexed, multitarget antifolate LY231514 (MTA), and oral 5-FU prodrugs. These combinations confer both an increased response rate compared to that of any single agent and an increased secondary surgical resection of initially unresectable metastases, possibly leading to prolonged survival. In three prospective randomized phase III studies in advanced CRC, oxaliplatin plus 5-FU/LV improved significantly progression-free survival without a significant increase in median survival time and without affecting quality of life, compared to treatment with 5-FU/LV. Ongoing clinical trials will define its role in the adjuvant setting."
False,past years enduring explanation schizophrenia dopamine hypothesis proposes dopaminergic system overactive widespread disease nan,9278187,dopamine,widespread disease,"For the past 20 years the most enduring explanation for schizophrenia has been the dopamine hypothesis, which proposes that the dopaminergic system is overactive in this widespread disease. Classically, the D2 receptor formed the core of the dopamine hypothesis since there was considerable evidence for elevations of D2 receptor levels in the brains of schizophrenic patients, and because these receptors served as the primary target in mediating antipsychotic effects of most neuroleptics. However, the dopamine D4 receptor has recently received particular attention in this context. This is because the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, which is effective in treating refractory schizophrenics without the side-effect profile of typical neuroleptics, displays a 10-fold higher affinity for D4 compared to D2 or D3 receptors. Furthermore, the concentration in plasma water of clinical doses ofclozapine correlates well with its in vitro binding affinity for D4, but not D2 or D3 receptors, suggesting that D4 is a potential target in mediating clozapine's antipsychotic effects. As well, marked elevations in the level of a D4-like site (not identical to the D4 receptor) has been seen in the striatum of postmortem schizophrenic brains, but not in control brains. Finally, the most interesting feature of the D4 receptor is perhaps the array of polymorphisms associated with it, creating structural diversity in this receptor that supercedes all other known catecholamine receptors. The existence of these D4 polymorphisms raises the possibility that structural variations of this receptor may be associated with an increased susceptibility to schizophrenia, or observed variations in individual response to clozapine treatment. However, several studies aimed at investigating these hypotheses could not establish a direct role of D4 in schizophrenia. Furthermore, no association was evident between the polymorphic forms of D4 and susceptibility to schizophrenia, or variable clozapine response. Nevertheless, investigations surrounding this receptor has been far from futile. The observations which support the idea that D4 might serve as a target for clozapine have significantly modified and extended our understanding of mechanisms underlying atypical antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia, as well as the dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia. Further characterization of this receptor may prove to be crucial in designing highly effective antipsychotic drugs with minimal contraindications."

Patients were randomized to receive pravastatin 10 mg or matching placebo with doubling of the dose after 8 weeks if predefined target levels for total cholesterol [(i.e., < 5.2 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) or > 15% decrease from baseline] had not been achieved. At Week 16, pravastatin-treated patients showed a 21.4% decrease in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a 13.5% reduction in serum total cholesterol (TC) concentrations (p < 0.001 compared with placebo). Levels of triglycerides (TG) were reduced 9.6% during pravastatin treatment (p < 0.05 compared with placebo) while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were increased 4.4% (p = NS). Adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities were similar among patients treated with pravastatin or placebo. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels remained unchanged. The results of this study demonstrate that low-dose pravastatin is effective and well tolerated for lowering elevated cholesterol concentrations during short-term treatment of patients with NIDDM and hypercholesterolemia."
False,ed common symptom patients type diabetes also low testosterone levelsnan,18843273,testosterone,type,"Obesity is an important risk factor for many common diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, cancer and erectile dysfunction (ED). Adipose tissues produce a number of adipokines and cytokines, which affect endothelial and metabolic function resulting in insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (risks factors for CVD). Both ED and metabolic syndrome improve with a reduction in body mass index (BMI). The relationships among obesity, metabolic syndrome, ED, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and serum total and free testosterone levels are complex and often confusing to the physician. It is known that BMI is inversely proportional to serum total testosterone concentrations; low serum SHBG levels in obesity contribute to the low serum total testosterone. Recent studies show that BMI is also inversely proportional to free testosterone concentration. The characteristic low serum testosterone concentrations observed in obese men are also present in men with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. A small proportion of men with ED have hypogonadism; however, the proportion increases if these men are obese with manifestations of the metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus. ED is a common symptom in patients with type 2 diabetes who also have low testosterone levels. This review describes the relationships between low serum testosterone concentrations and ED in obese patients and those with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus."

True,paraquat dimethylbipyridinium chloride pq nonselective herbicide pq poisoning accidental intentional ingestion cause numerous fatalities around world every yearnan,23291665,Paraquat,poisoning,"Paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium chloride, PQ) is a non-selective             herbicide, and PQ poisoning by accidental or intentional ingestion is a cause             of numerous fatalities around the world every year. Although a great deal of research             has been conducted into the development of an acceptable treatment for PQ poisoning,             no effective guidelines for patients have been developed thus far. Acai berry             extract and juice have been highlighted in this regard, due to their observed             antioxidant effects in various diseases. Furthermore, the acai berry has been             used in dietary supplements, as it contains a variety of nutrients, including             proteins, lipids, vitamins A, C and E and polyphenols. In this study, we conducted             proteomic analysis of PQ-poisoned rat lungs to evaluate the changes in protein             expression induced by PQ and to identify any protective effects of acai berry             on the PQ poisoning. Our data revealed that the expression of the calcium signaling-related             proteins calcium binding protein 1 (CaBP1), FK506 binding protein 4 (FKBP4), S100A6             and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (Sparc, also known as osteonectin)             were induced by PQ treatment and downregulated by acai berry treatment. However,             the levels of protein kinase C substrate 80K-H were shown to be downregulated             as the result of PQ treatment. Our results indicated that these proteins may function             as biomarkers for acute poisoning by PQ exposure. Further studies may be necessary             to understand their clinical relevance with regard to PQ poisoning."

We aimed to investigate the impact of the coadministration of TZD and ACEI/ARB on hematocrit and hemoglobin values in uncomplicated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal serum creatinine.Data from patients with type 2 diabetes currently followed, were reviewed and patients treated with ACEI/ARB and/or TZD were identified. For the purpose of this study the following 4 groups of 30 stable non-anemic diabetic patients each matched for age, gender, and BMI were formed. Group ACEI/ARB included patients on ACEI/ARB without TZD, group TZD included patients on TZD and antihypertensive agents other than ACEI/ARB, group ACEI/ARB/TZD consisted of patients on combined therapy with ACEI/ARB and TZD and the control group C included patients never exposed to ACEI/ARB or TZD. Clinical and laboratory data were collected prior to initiation of treatment and after 6 months.Neither hematocrit nor hemoglobin showed any significant change from baseline at the end of the study in group C. In both group ACEI/ARB and group TZD a small, but statistically significant reduction in hematocrit (~ 1% point) and hemoglobin levels (~ 0.3 g/dl) was seen. A greater statistically and clinically important reduction in hematocrit (~ 3% points) and hemoglobin (~ 1 g/dl) levels was observed in group  ACEI/ARB/TZD. Furthermore, incident anemia at the end reached 7% in group TZD and 23% in group ACEI/ARB/TZD.Coadministration of RAS inhibitors and PPAR-γ agonists should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hematocrit lowering and anemia in uncomplicated type 2 diabetic patients with normal serum creatinine.

False,recently shown abl fusion oncogenic tyrosine kinases bcr abl tel abl specific hematopoietic malignances induced resistance dnadamaging agentsnan,14987801,tyrosine,ABL,"Chromosomal translocations of tyrosine kinase c-ABL gene from chromosome 9 may generate oncogenic kinases exhibiting constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Recently, we have shown that ABL-fusion oncogenic tyrosine kinases, BCR/ABL and TEL/ABL, specific to hematopoietic malignances, induced resistance to DNA-damaging agents. To elucidate the role of DNA repair in this phenomenon we examined the capacity of murine BaF3 lymphoid cells and their TEL/ABL-transformed counterparts to repair DNA lesions caused by gamma- and UV-radiations and the anti-cancer drug, idarubicin. TEL/ABL-transformed cells displayed resistance to these DNA damaging agents as evaluated by MTT assay and the survival advantage was associated with an accelerated kinetics of DNA repair as measured by the alkaline comet assay. Deoxyribonucleosides (dNTPs) supplementation of the repair medium further stimulated DNA repair and the effect was specific to the DNA damage agent used in the experiment but only the transformed cells displayed this feature. A variety of damages induced imply the multi-pathway of DNA repair involved. We also examined the capability of BCR/ABL-fusion to modulate the repair of oxidative lesions, considered as a major side effect of various anti-cancer drugs including idarubicin and radiation. Employing the free radical scavenger alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN, a spin trap) and DNA repair enzymes: endonuclease III (EndoIII) that nicks DNA at sites of oxidized bases, we found that BCR/ABL-transformed cells repaired oxidative DNA lesions more effectively than control cells. Our results suggest, that oncogenic ABL-dependent stimulation of DNA repair may contribute to the cell resistance to genotoxic treatment."
False,mechanism underlying cell cycle arrest flavone markedly increases mrna protein levels universal inhibitor cyclindependent kinase pwaf inhibits phosphorylation retinoblastoma rb proteinnan,9804172,flavone,RB/retinoblastoma,"Flavonoids are present in many plants including edible fruits and vegetables. Recently, many of the biological activities of flavonoids have been elucidated. Flavone is a well known flavonoid, and many of its derivatives have been shown to have anti-proliferative effects on several cancer cells. We report here that flavone can effectively inhibit the cell growth of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and 100 microM flavone causes cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. As a mechanism underlying the cell cycle arrest, flavone markedly increases the mRNA and protein levels of a universal inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, p21/WAF1, and inhibits phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (RB) protein. Although A549 cells possess wild-type p53, flavone does not induce the p53 protein, suggesting that p21/WAF1 induction is p53-independent. In addition, 100 microM flavone significantly increases the promoter activity of the p21/WAF1 gene by 5-fold. These results suggest that the G1 phase arrest by flavone is due to p53-independent transcriptional induction of the p21/WAF1 gene and the subsequent dephosphorylation of RB protein."
True,dizziness nausea nin unsteadiness also depended nicotine dosage nicotine blood concentration better predictor temporal dependence nystagmus nicotine dosagenan,17990061,nicotine,Dizziness,"Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."
True,use adriamycin adr cancer chemotherapy limited due cumulative cardiovascular toxicity nan,9952311,ADR/adriamycin,cardiovascular toxicity,"The use of adriamycin (ADR) in cancer chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative cardiovascular toxicity. Earlier observations that ADR interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate ADR's action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb-c mice i.p. treated with ADR for several weeks. At various times during treatment, the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy. In parallel, total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady-state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII, COXIII, and COXIV genes. Similarly, samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies. Our results indicated that 1) treatment of mice with ADR caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia, extension of ventricular depolarization time (tQRS), and failure of QRS at high concentrations (10-14 mg/kg body weight cumulative dose); 2) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling, fusion, dissolution, and/or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment. Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue; and 3) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined, only COXII gene expression was suppressed by ADR treatment, mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver. Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40% of heart muscle by weight, we conclude that the deteriorating effects of ADR on cardiovascular function involve mitochondrial structural and functional impairment."

False,interestingly survival prolongation greater treatment started five two years infection striking increase survival time dose azt inhibiting hiv proliferation used instead lower one inducing inhibitionnan,7805931,AZT,infection,"A mathematical model of CD4+ lymphocyte depletion in HIV infection is used to simulate and analyse the effect of AZT treatment. In most cases, permanent administration of AZT is observed to stop the CD4+ lymphocyte count decline and to stimulate their increase up to a new steady-state level, which depends on the intensity of AZT treatment, i.e. AZT dose. Temporary administration of AZT leads only to a temporary increase in CD4+ lymphocyte count. After the treatment is terminated, the count starts to decline again. However, the resulting prolongation of patient's survival exceeds the time interval of AZT administration. Interestingly, the survival prolongation is greater, if the treatment is started at five than at two years after the infection and there is no striking increase in survival time if a dose of AZT inhibiting 75% of HIV proliferation is used instead of a lower one inducing 25% inhibition only."

The primary aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in symptom palliation of morphine-induced delirium. Twenty-one consecutive cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium underwent opioid rotation to fentanyl. Physicians recorded the symptom severity of delirium (the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, MDAS), pain, and other symptoms (categorical verbal scale from 0: none to 3: severe) and the Schedule for Team Assessment Scale (STAS) (from 0: none to 4: extreme); and performance status at the time of study enrollment and three and seven days after. Of 21 patients recruited, one patient did not complete the study. In the remaining 20 patients, morphine was substituted with transdermal fentanyl in 9 patients and parenteral fentanyl in 11 patients. Total opioid dose increased from 64 mg oral morphine equivalent/day (Day 0) to 98 mg/day (Day 7), and the median increase in total opioid dose was 42%. Treatment success, defined as an MDAS score below 10 and pain score of 2 or less, was obtained in 13 patients on Day 3 and 18 patients on Day 7. The mean MDAS score significantly decreased from 14 (Day 0) to 6.4 and 3.6 (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Pain scores significantly decreased from 2.2 (Day 0) to 1.3 and 1.1 on the categorical verbal scale (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001); from 2.6 (Day 0) to 1.6 and 1.3 on the STAS (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Symptom scores of dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting significantly decreased, and performance status significantly improved. Opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl may be effective in alleviating delirium and pain in cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium."
True,year case furosemide induced immune thrombocytopenia nan,23625769,furosemide,thrombocytopenia,"Immune thrombocytopenia has been attributed to many causes. Several drugs have been implicated as culprits in causing drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Although the mechanism for this type of thrombocytopenia is not well understood, at least three types of antibodies appear to be involved: drug-dependent antibodies, hapten-dependent antibodies, and drug-induced platelet-reactive autoantibodies. In this report, we describe a case in which furosemide was identified as the probable cause of drug-induced thrombocytopenia in an 84-year-old man with chronic symptomatic idiopathic thrombocytopenia for seven years before discovery. The patient's platelet count and daily furosemide dose, both intravenous and oral, were documented throughout his medical history. A dose-dependent change in platelet count was observed in association with the furosemide dose. His platelet count increased on discontinuation of furosemide and beginning of torsemide. Several months after discontinuation of furosemide, his platelet count increased to a 9-year high of 206 × 10³/mm³ from a low of 36 × 10³/mm³ while receiving furosemide therapy. Based on the observations of this case report, clinicians should more readily consider furosemide as a potential cause of thrombocytopenia."
True,hypothesis lung disease silicate inhalation caused oxidant generationnan,1977006,silicate,lung disease,"Inhaled silicate dusts may cause lung disease through their surface coordination of iron with subsequent oxidant generation via the Fenton reaction. Pneumoconiosis, irritant bronchitis, focal emphysema, and carcinoma may be produced by oxidants either directly through lipid peroxidation and protein inactivation, or indirectly by oxidant-mediated release of cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor. The increased incidence of tuberculosis observed among silicate workers could be explained by accumulation of iron complexed by dust particles in the lung and made available to dormant mycobacteria as a virulence factor."
True,although simvastatin patients improved significantly third day vs  nonsignificant increase mortality greater proportion infections odds ratio confidence interval simvastatin group main safety concernsnan,18070096,simvastatin,infections,"Although statins are being used for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke, recent experimental data have shown new pleiotropic effects of these drugs responsible for their role in neuroprotection. We conducted a pilot, double-blind, randomized, multicenter clinical trial to study for the first time safety and efficacy of simvastatin in the acute phase of ischemic stroke. Simvastatin/placebo was given at 3-12 h from symptom onset to 60 patients with cortical strokes. Efficacy on the evolution of several inflammation markers [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, C-reactive protein, sApo/Fas, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, E-selectin, L-selectin and nitrites+nitrates] and neurological outcome was evaluated at baseline, day 1, 3, 5, 7 and 90. No differences were found amongst the biomarkers studied regarding treatment allocation. Although simvastatin patients improved significantly by the third day (46.4% vs. 17.9%, P = 0.022), a non-significant increase in mortality and greater proportion of infections (odds ratio 2.4, confidence interval 1.06-5.4) in the simvastatin group were the main safety concerns. Therefore, a larger clinical trial is needed to confirm the net benefit of this therapeutic approach."

True,previously demonstrated indoxyl sulfate stimulating factor progression glomerular sclerosis uremic ratsnan,9387112,indoxyl sulfate,glomerular sclerosis,"We have previously demonstrated that indoxyl sulfate is a stimulating factor for the progression of glomerular sclerosis in uremic rats. In this study we determined if a low-protein diet or oral sorbent (AST-120) could reduce the serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate in 5/6-nephrectomized uremic rats and undialyzed uremic patients. The uremic rats were treated by fasting or AST-120 for 2 days. The serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate dramatically decreased 1-2 days after fasting or AST-120 treatment. We then measured the serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate and calculated protein intake from urinary amounts of urea nitrogen using Maroni's equation in 80 undialyzed uremic patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min. The serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate were significantly lower in the patients on a low-protein diet than in those in the normal-protein diet group. Administration of AST-120 significantly decreased serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate in 22 undialyzed uremic patients. In conclusion, a low-protein diet or AST-120 reduced the serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate, a stimulating factor for glomerular sclerosis, in both uremic rats and undialyzed uremic patients."

True,murine macrophages incubated either vldl oleic acid content adrp triacylglycerol tg increased foldnan,16230742,oleic acid,ADRP,"Adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) is a major protein associated with lipid droplets in various types of cells, including macrophage-derived foam cells and liver cells. However, the role of ADRP in the processes of formation and regression of these cells is not understood. When J774 murine macrophages were incubated with either VLDL or oleic acid, their content of both ADRP and triacylglycerol (TG) increased 3- to 4-fold. Induction of ADRP during TG accumulation was also observed in oleic acid-treated HuH-7 human liver cells. Addition of triacsin C, a potent inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthase, for 6 h decreased the amount of TG in VLDL-induced foam cells and oleic acid-treated liver cells; it decreased the amount of ADRP protein in parallel, indicating the amount of ADRP reduced during regression of the lipid-storing cells. Addition of a proteasome inhibitor during triacsin C treatment abolished the ADRP decrease and accumulated polyubiquitinated ADRP. In addition, the proteasome inhibitor reversed not only the degradation of ADRP but also TG reduction by triacsin C. These results suggest that cellular amounts of ADRP and TG regulate each other and that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in degradation of ADRP during regression of lipid-storing cells."
False,significant toxicity induced dose cisplatin tissues except hemosiderin accumulation spleen normal tumorbearing micenan,20540689,cisplatin,toxicity,"Cisplatin is one of the commonly-used chemotherapeutic drugs to efficiently treat malignant tumors in clinic, however, the adverse effects of cisplatin such as nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and hemolytic uremic syndrome are often observed at its clinical doses (approximately 60 mg/m(2)), which limit its broader application. In earlier studies, little attention was paid to the subtle changes in the architecture of lymphatic organs after low doses of cisplatin treatment. This paper reviews current understanding of cisplatin-induced erythrocyte injury, and presents our latest finding that a low dose of cisplatin (3.6 mg/m(2)/day, 14 days) could induce specific hemosiderin deposition in spleen of both normal and hepatoma-22 (H22) inoculated Balb/C mice. This dose of cisplatin significantly inhibited H22-induced acute ascites development. No significant toxicity was induced by this dose of cisplatin to tissues except for hemosiderin accumulation in the spleen of both normal and H22 tumor-bearing mice. Increased splenic iron content and erythrocyte injury were observed after treatment with the low dose of cisplatin. The mRNA levels of ferroportin (FPN1) and ferritin were upregulated by 25 and 5-fold in spleen, respectively. Overexpression of FPN1 and ferritin protein were also been observed at protein levels by Western blotting analysis. In addition, the mRNA expression of hepcidin was also increased, suggesting blockage of iron recycling through FPN1 in spleen with cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, cisplatin treatment damages the erythrocytes which accumulate in the red pulp of spleen with defective recycling of FPN1 and ferritin protein. Hepcidin inhibits the function of FPN1 as iron-exporter leading to iron overloaded inside ferritins of splenic cells, which are stained with abnormal hemosiderin accumulation. These results demonstrate that cisplatin-caused hemosiderin deposition in spleen provides a valuable clue for understanding the molecular basis of toxicity of cisplatin and hemosiderin accumulation and iron metabolism in vivo."

Acetaminophen-poisoned cats develop methemoglobinemia and sometimes hepatic failure. To determine the benefit of using methylene blue, a treatment for methemoglobinemia, along with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the recommended treatment for acetaminophen-poisoned cats, groups of 3 male and 3 female cats each were given methylene blue NAC, or both after administration of acetaminophen (120 mg/kg of body weight, PO). Male cats seemed more susceptible than female cats to acetaminophen toxicosis, because 3 males died of hepatic failure (2 cats given acetaminophen/methylene blue and 1 given acetaminophen/NAC/methylene blue). Although NAC alone seemed to elicit the best overall response, methylene blue, alone or in combination with NAC, may be useful in female cats."

In order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of heparin and graduated compression stockings, we conducted a cohort study of 55 consecutive fractures hip patients treated postoperatively with heparin, 5,000 U every 12 h, and graduated compression stockings. The rates of venous thromboembolism and bleeding were compared with an historical cohort from Hamilton. Before discharge, 51 patients underwent bilateral venography. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) occurred in 10 of the 51 patients (incidence of 20%); three had proximal DVT (incidence of proximal DVT was 6%). DVT was seen in 29 of the 63 control patients (incidence 46%); 19 had proximal DVT (incidence of proximal DVT was 30%). The differences in the rates of DVT and proximal DVT are statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Bleeding occurred in one patient in the treatment group (incidence 2%) and five patients in the control group (incidence 8%). This study confirms that therapy with heparin and graduated compression stockings is effective, inexpensive, and convenient for the prevention of venous thrombosis in fractured hip patients and is associated with a low bleeding risk."
False,studies needed establish whether bindarit may function steroid sparing drug human lupus nan,9507220,steroid,lupus,"As an alternative to classical immunosuppressants in experimental lupus nephritis, we looked at bindarit, 2-methyl-2-[[1-phenylmethyl)-1H-indazol-3-y1]methoxy]propanoic acid, a novel molecule devoid of immunosuppressive effects, which selectively reduces chronic inflammation in rat adjuvant arthritis. Two groups of NZB/W mice (N = 55 for each group) were given bindarit, (50 mg/kg/day p.o.) or vehicle starting at 2 months of age. Mice were sacrificed at 2, 6, 8 and 10 months or used for survival studies. Bindarit delayed the onset of proteinuria (% proteinuric mice, bindarit vs. vehicle, 6 months: 0 vs. 33% and 8 months: 7% vs. 60%, P < 0.005; 10 months: 53% vs. 80%) and significantly (P < 0.05) protected from renal function impairment (serum BUN, bindarit vs. vehicle: 8 months, 30 +/- 3 vs. 127 +/- 42; 10 months, 53 +/-5 vs. 140 +/- 37 mg/dl). Appearance of anti-DNA antibodies was retarded and survival significantly (P < 0.0001) prolonged by bindarit (% survival, bindarit vs. vehicle: 8 months, 100% vs. 80%; 10 months, 87% vs. 40%; 12 months, 27% vs. 20%). Bindarit significantly limited glomerular hypercellularity, interstitial inflammation and tubular damage. Renal expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) mRNA (Northern blot) markedly increased (7 - 12-fold in 8- 10-month-old mice vs. 2-month-old) during the progression of nephritis in association with mononuclear cell infiltration. Bindarit completely prevented MCP-1 up-regulation. In another series of experiments, bindarit (0.25% and 0.5% medicated diet, N = 16 for each group) when started at 4.5 months of age in NZB/W mice improved survival in respect to untreated mice (N = 17) in a dose-dependent manner (% survival: 8 months, 94% and 100%, respectively, vs. 47%; 10 months, 75% and 100% vs. 35%; 12 months, 31% and 75% vs. 12%). Survival was even more prolonged when bindarit (0.5% medicated diet) was combined with a low dose of methylprednisolone (1.5 mg/kg i.p.), which that only partially modifies proteinuria and survival of lupus mice, in an additional group of animals (N = 16). Thus, at 14.5 months when all mice given bindarit alone died, 50% of mice on combined therapy were still alive (P < 0.023). Studies are needed to establish whether bindarit may function as a steroid sparing drug in human lupus."
True,refractory gcse often difficult treat traditional therapy barbiturates induces hypotension respiratory depression prolongs recoverynan,10516875,barbiturates,respiratory depression,"Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is a medical emergency requiring prompt resolution. Acute treatment is often delayed by difficulty in obtaining intravenous (i.v.) access. Refractory GCSE is often difficult to treat, and traditional therapy with barbiturates induces hypotension and respiratory depression and prolongs recovery. Midazolam is particularly useful for treating acute GCSE because it has an imidazole ring that is open at low pH, allowing it to be dissolved in aqueous solution for intramuscular injection, but closed at physiologic pH, increasing lipophilicity and rendering good intramuscular absorption, brain penetration, and fast onset of action. When given intramuscularly as a 0.2 mg/kg bolus, it has efficacy at least equal to that of i.v. diazepam, is well tolerated, induces little respiratory compromise, and has a shorter latency to onset of action. Therefore, it should be considered for the treatment of acute GCSE when i.v. access is problematic. For refractory GCSE, continuous i.v. midazolam infusion at 0.1-0.6 mg/kg/hr after a 0.2 mg/kg i.v. bolus is effective and has advantages over traditional therapies because it induces less hypotension and cardiorespiratory depression and can be easily titrated. Further prospective studies are needed to define the role of continuous i.v. midazolam compared to other contemporary therapies."

Results for cell viability indictated no notable differences between OA and ethanol extract of PV in lung adenocarcinoma SPC-A-1 cells measured by MTT assay. Consistent concentration-response curves. Fluorescence detection with acridine orange-ethidium bromide was used to evaluate apoptosis of SPC-A-1 cells. OA at 16 and 8 microM group increased significantly the apoptosis rate compared with normal and 1% DMSO groups (p<0.05). In addition, immunocytochemistry assays showed increase in Bax and Bad protein expression while Bcl-2 decreased. Moreover, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 was heightened by OA treatment. The results suggest OA induced apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cells through down-regulating Bcl-2 expression, and up-regulating Bax and Bad expression."
True,since introduction immunomodulatory derivatives imids thalidomide lenalidomide therapeutic armamentarium mm vte emerged one leading complications particular patients newly diagnosed mmnan,21455855,lenalidomide,VTE,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease with a high prevalence in elderly people, affecting > 5% of the population > 65 years of age. Cancer patients have a 4.3-fold higher incidence of thrombotic complications, due to multiple risk factors that are not always related to the disease. Among hematologic malignancies, multiple myeloma (MM) confers a high risk of developing such complications, with a VTE rate of nearly 10%. Multiple factors are involved in MM-related VTE, such as increased blood viscosity, high levels of immunoglobulin, procoagulant activity of monoclonal protein, and inflammatory cytokines. Since the introduction of the immunomodulatory derivatives (IMiDs) thalidomide and lenalidomide in the therapeutic armamentarium of MM, VTE has emerged as one of the leading complications, in particular in patients with newly diagnosed MM. In this setting, IMiDs-based treatments are associated with rates of VTE reaching values up to 14 to 26%, particularly when dexamethasone or chemotherapy are added. The optimal prophylaxis for patients receiving these antiangiogenetic agents is still a matter of debate. Due to the lack of prospective randomized clinical trials, different studies have used various anticoagulant prophylaxes, including fixed low-dose warfarin (1 mg or 1.25 mg), therapeutic doses of warfarin (international normalized ratio between 2.0 and 3.0), low molecular weight heparin, or low-dose aspirin. As yet, no study has clearly demonstrated a significant superiority of one prophylactic regimen in comparison with the others. Further investigation and more randomized clinical trials are needed to define the best thromboprophylaxis."

False,include forced hyperventilation paco indomethacin induced hypothermia nan,18286835,indomethacin,hypothermia,"Intracranial pressure (ICP) is the pressure exerted by cranial contents on the dural envelope. It comprises the partial pressures of brain, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Normal intracranial pressure is somewhere below 10 mmHg; it may increase as a result of traumatic brain injury, stroke, neoplasm, Reye's syndrome, hepatic coma, or other pathologies. When ICP increases above 20 mmHg it may damage neurons and jeopardize cerebral perfusion. If such a condition persists, treatment is indicated. Control of ICP requires measurement, which can only be performed invasively. Standard techniques include direct ventricular manometry or measurement in the parenchyma with electronic or fiberoptic devices. Displaying the time course of pressure (high-resolution ICP tonoscopy) allows assessment of the validity of the signal and identification of specific pathological findings, such as A-, B- and C-waves. When ICP is pathologically elevated--at or above 20-25 mmHg--it needs to be lowered. A range of treatment modalities is available and should be applied with consideration of the underlying cause. When intracranial hypertension is caused by hematoma, contusion, tumor, hygroma, hydrocephalus or pneumatocephalus, surgical treatment is indicated. In the absence of a surgically treatable condition, ICP may be controlled by correcting the patient's position, temperature, ventilation or hemodynamics. If intracranial hypertension persists, drainage of CSF via external drainage is most effective. Other first-tier options include induced hypocapnea (hyperventilation; paCO2 < 35 mmHg), hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol, hypertonic saline) and induced arterial hypertension (CPP concept). When autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is compromised, hyperoncotic treatment aimed at reducing vasogenic edema and intracranial blood volume may be applied. When intracranial hypertension persists, second-tier treatments may be indicated. These include 'forced hyperventilation' (paCO2 < 25 mmHg), barbiturate coma or experimental protocols such as tris buffer, indomethacin or induced hypothermia. The last resort is emergent bilateral decompressive craniectomy; once taken into consideration, it should be performed without undue delay."

The pathogenesis of this myalgia is still unclear; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evidence. We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this myalgia. The incidence and severity of succinylcholine-associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before succinylcholine (n = 32 for each). Incidence and severity of myalgia did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of myalgia compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe myalgia was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively (not significant). At 48 h after surgery, 12 patients in both groups still suffered from myalgia (not significant). In addition, interleukin-6 (IL-6) as an early marker of inflammation was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline. We found an increase of IL-6 for only three patients, but only one patient reported myalgia; no relationship between myalgia and the increase of IL-6 was found. In conclusion, there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of succinylcholine-associated myalgia."

It can cause considerable discomfort and has a major impact on patients' quality of life. In the field of palliative care, pruritus is a symptom occurring in patients with disparate underlying diseases and based on different pathologic mechanisms but ending in the same phenomenon. The pathogenesis of pruritus is complex and not fully elucidated. Thus, it is still very difficult to treat pruritus effectively. Evidence-based treatment approaches are needed."
False,aim study test fluticasone propionate fp efficacy treatment patients bronchial asthma ba controlled high doses mg inhaled corticosteroidsnan,10660975,fluticasone propionate,bronchial asthma/BA,"The aim of the study was to test the fluticasone propionate (FP) efficacy in the treatment of patients with bronchial asthma (BA), not controlled by high doses (more than 1 mg) of other inhaled corticosteroids. Asthma symptoms (degree of dyspnea on Sadoul scale, percentage of symptom-free days and nights), and drug consumption were measured and lung function tests were performed in 20 patients (11 women and 9 men, mean age 47 years) for a 2 months period. Biochemical measurements were done referring to oxidant/antioxidant imbalance, which is characteristic to inflammatory diseases of respiratory system. We evaluated lipoperoxidation (LPO) in the plasma and the blood, before and after FP treatment, by determining malondialdehyde (MDA) status, superoxide-dismutase and ceruloplasmine activity and non-protein SH groups (essential glutathione) status. The biochemical measurements showed a significant decrease in lipid peroxides level in the plasma and the blood and a slight increase of glutathione after 2 months treatment with FP. Lung function tests were performed on a Flow Streen Jaeger and we determined: peak expiratory flow (PEF), vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec. (FEV1) and mid-expiratory flow at 50% VC (MEF50). The measurements were done before FP administration, after 3 days, 7 days, 1 month and 2 months. The dose of FP was equivalent to 50-75% of the daily dose of Beclomethasone dipropionate (BD) previously administered. The degree of dyspnea diminished from 3-4 to 0-1. The percentage of symptom-free days and nights improved from 12% to 78% and 25% to 95% respectively. The use of short acting beta agonists diminished with 75% and no patients required i.v. corticotherapy or theophylline. PEF increased with a mean of 25%, VC with a mean of 23%, FEV1 with a mean of 30% and MEF50 with a mean of 36%. Our results demonstrate improved efficacy of FP vs high doses of other inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of moderate persistent and severe forms of BA."

False,clinical efficacy zaleplon persists least four weeks doses mg mg studies patients history drug abuse suggest abuse potential zaleplon doses therapeutic dose range similar seen benzodiazepine triazolamnan,11060714,benzodiazepine,drug abuse,"Zaleplon (N-[3-(3-cyanopyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidin-7-yl) phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide) is a non-benzodiazepine recently introduced for clinical use. This agent is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Preclinical studies have shown that the benzodiazepines triazolam and Ro17-1812 can substitute for zaleplon in animals trained to distinguish zaleplon from saline. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can antagonise the discriminative stimulus effect of zaleplon. These findings suggest that zaleplon is recognised by animals as a benzodiazepine agent. Zaleplon is active after ip. and oral administration in a variety of motor performance tests, including locomotor activity, rotarod and the loaded grid. Zaleplon has been shown to be active in a number of different anticonvulsant models, including the pentylenetetrazole, isoniazid and electroshock models. The compound is also reported to be active against convulsions induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin and strychnine. Studies in anxiolytic models suggest that zaleplon may have weak anxiolytic activity. From preclinical studies, it appears zaleplon possesses a reduced risk of tolerance compared to triazolam, is less likely to potentiate the effects of ethanol and is unlikely to produce amnestic effects. In man, zaleplon is rapidly absorbed and undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism. The compound has a plasma half-life of approximately one hour and is metabolised primarily via the aldehyde oxidase system to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. This metabolite, along with other minor metabolites formed in vivo, do not appear to contribute to the activity of zaleplon. Metabolites of zaleplon are excreted primarily via the urine. Phase I studies suggest that single daytime doses of zaleplon up to 15 mg are well-tolerated. Short-term impairment of performance occurs when zaleplon is administered during the day at doses epsilon 20 mg. However, given the short half-life of the compound, significant impairment of daytime performance is unlikely if zaleplon is administered at bedtime or shortly after retiring for the evening. Results from Phase II/III studies suggest that zaleplon (5 - 20 mg) produces a dose-dependent reduction in sleep latency in patients suffering from primary insomnia. The clinical efficacy of zaleplon persists for at least four weeks at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. Studies in patients with a history of drug abuse suggest that the abuse potential of zaleplon (at doses above the therapeutic dose range) is similar to that seen with the benzodiazepine triazolam."
True,pretreatment ketamine produced crosstolerance morphine whereas pretreatment morphine induce crosstolerance ketamine rather augmented cataleptic response augmentation attributed residual morphine brainnan,2716967,morphine,cataleptic,"Previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and morphine induced analgesia and catalepsy in the rat. Pre-treatment with ketamine produced cross-tolerance to morphine, whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross-tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the cataleptic response; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain. The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, administered simultaneously. There was mutual potentiation between sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, but sub-effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully-effective doses of morphine. Latency to the loss of righting reflex, rigidity and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of ketamine or morphine in each combination. Naloxone inhibited the induced cataleptic effects. The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub-effective dose combinations of ketamine and morphine were similar. Rats, tolerant to ketamine-dominant combinations, were cross-tolerant to both drugs, while those tolerant to morphine-dominant combinations were cross-tolerant to morphine but showed either no cross-tolerance or an augmented response to ketamine. While the mutual potentiation, antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced catalepsy, differences in latency, rigidity and behavior, asymmetry of cross-tolerance and a widely-different ID50 for naloxone would argue against an action at a single opioid site."

False,three patients nonfatal cardioembolic stroke aspirin group none coumadin group three years followupnan,7798824,coumadin,cardioembolic stroke,"The comparative study of the efficacy of coumadin and aspirin in primary cardioembolic stroke prevention of chronic rheumatic heart disease (mitral stenosis) with atrial fibrillation was conducted at Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the trial. Allocation of patients into coumadin or aspirin groups depended upon the patients' choice. Nineteen patients were given coumadin at the adjusted dosage to maintain the therapeutic range of International Normalised Ratio between 1.5-3. Sixty patients were given aspirin at the fixed dosage of 75 mg per day. Six patients were lost to follow-up over the 3 yr period; four in the aspirin group and 2 in the coumadin group. There were three patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke in the aspirin group but none in the coumadin group after three years of follow-up. Six patients had mitral valve replacement during the study (i.e. three patients in each group). There were complications in 12 patients, 10 in the aspirin (16.6 per cent) and 2 in the coumadin (10.5 per cent) group. The complications in coumadin group were minor bleeding over the thigh in one patient and generalised ecchymosis over the whole body in one other. In the aspirin group, the complication was gastrointestional symptoms, mainly epigastric pain, but no frank bleeding was observed. Primary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in chronic rheumatic heart disease was found to be more effective with coumadin than aspirin. Our study does not support the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiac embolism in chronic rheumatic heart disease."
True,dexamethasone treatment children showed higher rate minor neurological dysfunctions nan,15814210,dexamethasone,neurological dysfunctions,"The objective of this study was to assess minor neurological dysfunction, cognitive development, and somatic development after dexamethasone therapy in very-low-birthweight infants. Thirty-three children after dexamethasone treatment were matched to 33 children without dexamethasone treatment. Data were assessed at the age of 3-7 years. Dexamethasone was started between the 7th and the 28th day of life over 7 days with a total dose of 2.35 mg/kg/day. Exclusion criteria were asphyxia, malformations, major surgical interventions, small for gestational age, intraventricular haemorrhage grades III and IV, periventricular leukomalacia, and severe psychomotor retardation. Each child was examined by a neuropediatrician for minor neurological dysfunctions and tested by a psychologist for cognitive development with a Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and a Draw-a-Man Test. There were no differences in demographic data, growth, and socio-economic status between the two groups. Fine motor skills and gross motor function were significantly better in the control group (p<0.01). In the Draw-a-Man Test, the control group showed better results (p<0.001). There were no differences in development of speech, social development, and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. After dexamethasone treatment, children showed a higher rate of minor neurological dysfunctions. Neurological development was affected even without neurological diagnosis. Further long-term follow-up studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the impact of dexamethasone on neurological and cognitive development."

Here, we report that H2O2-induced cellular toxicity acts through Prdx6 hyperoxidation. Under high concentrations of H2O2 (> 100 microm), Prdx6, and 2-Cys Prdxs were hyperoxidized. Contrary to hyperoxidation of 2-Cys Prdxs, hyperoxidation of Prdx6 was irreversible in vivo. Surprisingly, H2O2-induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition correlated with hyperoxidation and increased iPLA2 activity of Prdx6. This arrest was also associated with up-regulation of p53 and p21 and with down-regulation of cyclin B1. Furthermore, the H2O2-mediated increase in iPLA2 activity was dramatically abolished in a hyperoxidation mutant (C47A), an iPLA2 mutant (S32A), and a double mutant (C47A/S32A) of Prdx6, demonstrating the essential requirement of Prdx6 C47 hyperoxidation for its iPLA2 activity. Together, our results demonstrate that H2O2-mediated hyperoxidation of Prdx6 induces cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition through up-regulation of iPLA2 activity."
False,week trial asenapine adjunctive therapy lithium valproate asenapine effective placebo improving manic symptoms based difference groups ymrs total score week primary endpointnan,21323396,lithium,manic symptoms,"Asenapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent available in sublingual formulations (5 or 10 mg) and indicated in the US (Saphris) for the acute treatment, as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, of manic and mixed episodes and in the EU (Sycrest) for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes, in adult patients with bipolar I disorder. In two large (both n = 480), well designed, 3-week trials in adult patients with bipolar I disorder, asenapine monotherapy was significantly more effective than placebo at improving mania symptoms, as assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale total score (YMRS; primary endpoint), with significant differences between the asenapine and placebo groups occurring after 2 days of treatment. In both trials, Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) scale mania severity scores exceeded those of placebo. In one trial, response and remission rates exceeded those of placebo. In a 9-week extension study that recruited completers from the monotherapy trials, there were no significant differences between asenapine and olanzapine groups in terms in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, CGI-BP mania severity scores, YMRS response rates or YMRS remission rates during the extension phase. In the extension study, the efficacy of asenapine monotherapy appeared to be maintained over 40 weeks (total treatment duration of 52 weeks). In a 12-week trial of asenapine as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate, asenapine was more effective than placebo in improving manic symptoms, based on the difference between groups in the YMRS total score at week 3 (primary endpoint). Most adverse events associated with asenapine were of mild to moderate severity, with <7% of asenapine recipients experiencing serious adverse events (vs 7% with placebo). In a pooled analysis of the monotherapy trials, the most common adverse events (occurring in ≥ 5% of patients and at twice the incidence of placebo) reported during acute phase asenapine monotherapy for bipolar mania were somnolence, dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS, other than akathisia) and increased bodyweight, which were similar in nature to those occurring during longer-term monotherapy with asenapine. EPS did not worsen in severity during longer-term asenapine monotherapy. Asenapine had minimal effects on plasma glucose, lipid and prolactin levels over both short- and longer-term treatment periods, and had little pro-arrhythmogenic potential. Further active comparator trials and longer-term tolerability and safety data are required. In the meantime, asenapine is a further option for the management of manic and/or mixed symptoms in patients with bipolar I disorder and may be of particular value for patients who are at high risk for metabolic abnormalities."

True,observations indicate prolonged depletion adrenergic stores guanethidine induces adrenergic supersensitivity cutaneous vessels adrenergic supersensitivity enhances thermal hyperalgesia presence noradrenaline nan,11474550,noradrenaline,thermal hyperalgesia,"Supersensitivity to noradrenaline contributes to certain vascular disorders (e.g., hypertension) and chronic neuropathic pain conditions (e.g., complex regional pain syndrome). We aimed to develop a procedure for inducing adrenergic supersensitivity that could be used to investigate the role of catecholamines in these clinical conditions. In the first study, three doses of guanethidine were administered by iontophoresis to separate small patches of skin in the forearm of healthy human volunteers. Four to five hours later. the vasoconstrictor response to the adrenergic releasing agent tyramine was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by iontophoretic pretreatment with guanethidine, indicating that guanethidine had depleted endogenous adrenergic stores. In a second study, guanethidine and saline were administered by iontophoresis four times over approximately 2 weeks at separate sites in the forearm. One to two days after the final pretreatment, vasoconstriction to the iontophoresis of a weak dose of noradrenaline was enhanced at sites pretreated with guanethidine. To investigate the effect of guanethidine pretreatment on thermal hyperalgesia. the experimental sites were sensitized to heat by the topical application of 0.6% capsaicin. Both before and after the application of capsaicin, the heat-pain threshold and heat-pain ratings to suprathreshold stimulation were similar at sites pretreated for 2 weeks with guanethidine or saline. However, after the iontophoresis of noradrenaline, thermal hyperalgesia was greater at the guanethidine-pretreated site than the saline pretreated site. These observations indicate that prolonged depletion of adrenergic stores by guanethidine induces adrenergic supersensitivity in cutaneous vessels, and that adrenergic supersensitivity enhances thermal hyperalgesia in the presence of noradrenaline."
True,bortezomib exerted dosedependent increase mirb expression aml blasts ex vivo followed decreased dnmts reduced proliferation increased apoptosisnan,24085765,Bortezomib,AML,"The coexpression of the MLL partial tandem duplication (PTD) and the FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations associate with a poor outcome in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In mice, a double knock-in (dKI) of Mll(PTD/wt) and Flt3(ITD/wt) mutations induces spontaneous AML with an increase in DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt1, 3a, and 3b) and global DNA methylation index, thereby recapitulating its human AML counterpart. We determined that a regulator of Dnmts, miR-29b, is downregulated in bone marrow of dKI AML mice. Bortezomib exerted a dose-dependent increase in miR-29b expression in AML blasts ex vivo, followed by decreased Dnmts, reduced proliferation, and increased apoptosis. In vivo, bortezomib was not active against dKI AML, yet liposomal-encapsulated bortezomib, as a single agent, reversed downregulation of miR-29b in vivo and induced a long-term (90-day) disease-free remission in 80% of dKI AML mice that exhibited high leukemic burden at the start of therapy, yet showed no signs of relapse at autopsy. Taken together, these data support that liposomal bortezomib, as a single agent, eradicates Mll(PTD/wt):Flt3(ITD/wt) AML in mouse and may represent a powerful and potentially curative approach to high-risk human disease.

He was admitted with acute myopathy of the lower limbs which resolved in a few days after pravastatin discontinuation. A previously unknown hypothyroidism, probably due to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, was evidenced. Muscle biopsy (left gastrocnemius) revealed a perimysial and endomysial inflammatory infiltrate with a prevalence of CD4+ lymphocytes. While lovastatin and simvastatin have been associated with toxic myopathy, pravastatin-associated myopathy could represent a distinct, inflammatory entity."

The extracts were tested for antiproliferative effects, and the reversal of MDR in mouse lymphoma cells. The possible chemopreventive effect of the chloroform extracts was studied on the expression of cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early (IE) antigen in human lung cancer cells (A549). The antimicrobial effects of the extracts were tested on some representative micro-organisms. Certain of the chloroform extracts of the plant materials were the most effective compounds on the reversal of MDR. Two of the chloroform extracts enhanced the antiproliferative effect of doxorubicin on MDR mouse lymphoma cells. The selected extracts did not show any antibacterial effect with the agar diffusion method. Certain chloroform extracts decreased the intermediate IE antigen expression of CMV in A459 cells."

The initial management of NIDDM should include patient education, dietary counselling and individualized programs of physical activity. It is only when such measures fail that drug therapy should be considered. Oral drug therapies include sulphonylurea derivatives, biguanides, among which metformin remains the only one commercialized in our country, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose. However, insulin therapy may be required to achieve adequate glycaemic control in some patients, the so-called secondary failures to oral treatment. The rationale for combining insulin and oral drug therapy derives from a better understanding of the pathophysiology of NIDDM and of the mechanisms of action of the oral drugs available: 1) type 2 diabetic patients are both insulin-deficient and insulin-resistant, thus requiring quite high doses of exogenous insulin; 2) peripheral insulin delivery leads to hyperinsulinaemia which could play a role in the pathogenesis of late diabetic complications; 3) sulphonylureas stimulate insulin release directly into the portal vein and could also potentiate peripheral insulin action; and 4) metformin (by improving glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity) and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (by slowing down the digestion of complex carbohydrates and sucrose) are able to reduce the amounts of insulin needed to control postprandial hyperglycaemia. Numerous studies have shown that a combination of insulin and sulphonylurea is more effective than insulin alone in the treatment of patients with NIDDM after secondary failure to oral drugs, leading to better glucose profiles and/or decreased insulin needs. The available data suggest that combination therapy is most beneficial in the diabetic patient who still has residual insulin secretory capacity and that the best scheme comprises an evening injection of lente insulin and the administration of sulphonylureas before meals. Preliminary results suggested that insulin-metformin (when obesity is present) or insulin-acarbose (when post-prandial hyperglycaemia occurs) combinations might offer some favourable features for the treatment of NIDDM patients although these therapeutical approaches still require adequate evaluation in further controlled studies. The additional cost of such combined therapy should be weighed against the potential advantages of better metabolic control."

After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient recovered cardiac rhythm. The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia. This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP). These mechanisms are not well understood because, in most cases, the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event. Rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here, and the authors discount ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism."

BK virus (BKV) has been commonly found to be associated with hematuria in stem cell transplant patients; however, it has rarely been reported after cyclophosphamide chemotherapy alone. The authors present 3 cases of BK viruria with HC in nontransplant pediatric oncology patients. The 3 patients with BKV had more prolonged hematuria (14 to 16 wk) compared with 1 patient with BKV-negative HC (10 wk). The HC necessitated chemotherapy delays and also prolonged supportive care. One patient was treated with intravenous cidofovir with resolution of BK viruria and hematuria. BKV may have an association with the development of HC in nonstem cell transplant patients receiving high-dose oxazophosphorine chemotherapy. HC may present early and be more prolonged in patients with BK viruria. Patients with HC after cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide with negative bacterial cultures should be studied for BKV. Cidofovir may be beneficial in certain patients with BK viruria and HC; however, definitive data will require a clinical trial."

The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone."

Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic prazosin treatment alters the alpha 2-adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Conscious SHR (male 300-350 g) were subjected to 90 degrees head-up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.) or rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.). Orthostatic hypotension was determined by the average decrease (%) in mean arterial pressure (MAP femoral) over the 60-s tilt period. The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by prazosin (-23%(-)-26% MAP) and rauwolscine (-16%(-)-33% MAP). However, the head-up tilt induced orthostatic hypotension in the SHR treated with prazosin (-16% MAP, n = 6), but not in the SHR treated with rauwolscine (less than +2% MAP, n = 6). 3. Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with prazosin at 2 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p. for chronic alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. MAP in conscious SHR after chronic prazosin treatment was 14% lower than in the untreated SHR (n = 8). Head-up tilts in these rats did not produce orthostatic hypotension when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.). Conversely, administration of rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.) in chronic prazosin treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12-31% (n = 4), and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19-23% in these rats. 4. The pressor responses and bradycardia to the alpha 1-agonist cirazoline (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist Abbott-53693 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and noradrenaline (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic prazosin pretreatment. Both the pressor and bradycardia effects of cirazoline were abolished in chronic prazosin treated SHR (n = 4) as compared to the untreated SHR (n = 4). On the other hand, the pressor effects of Abbott-53693 were similar in both groups of SHR, but the accompanying bradycardia was greater in SHR with chronic prazosin treatment than without such treatment. Furthermore, the bradycardia that accompanied the noradrenaline-induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic prazosin treatment despite a 47-71% reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1-receptor blocked SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
False, amid world war penicillin found effective treatment syphilis nan,23054260,penicillin,syphilis,"It was not until 1943, amid world war, that penicillin was found to be an effective treatment for syphilis. This study investigated the hypothesis that a decrease in the cost of syphilis due to penicillin spurred an increase in risky non-traditional sex. Using nationally comprehensive vital statistics, this study found evidence that the era of modern sexuality originated in the mid to late 1950s. Measures of risky non-traditional sexual behavior began to rise during this period. These trends appeared to coincide with the collapse of the syphilis epidemic. Syphilis incidence reached an all-time low in 1957 and syphilis deaths fell rapidly during the 1940s and early 1950s. Regression analysis demonstrated that most measures of sexual behavior significantly increased immediately following the collapse of syphilis and most measures were significantly associated with the syphilis death rate. Together, the findings supported the notion that the discovery of penicillin decreased the cost of syphilis and thereby played an important role in shaping modern sexuality."
False,include forced hyperventilation paco barbiturate coma experimental protocols tris buffer indomethacin induced hypothermia nan,18286835,barbiturate,hypothermia,"Intracranial pressure (ICP) is the pressure exerted by cranial contents on the dural envelope. It comprises the partial pressures of brain, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Normal intracranial pressure is somewhere below 10 mmHg; it may increase as a result of traumatic brain injury, stroke, neoplasm, Reye's syndrome, hepatic coma, or other pathologies. When ICP increases above 20 mmHg it may damage neurons and jeopardize cerebral perfusion. If such a condition persists, treatment is indicated. Control of ICP requires measurement, which can only be performed invasively. Standard techniques include direct ventricular manometry or measurement in the parenchyma with electronic or fiberoptic devices. Displaying the time course of pressure (high-resolution ICP tonoscopy) allows assessment of the validity of the signal and identification of specific pathological findings, such as A-, B- and C-waves. When ICP is pathologically elevated--at or above 20-25 mmHg--it needs to be lowered. A range of treatment modalities is available and should be applied with consideration of the underlying cause. When intracranial hypertension is caused by hematoma, contusion, tumor, hygroma, hydrocephalus or pneumatocephalus, surgical treatment is indicated. In the absence of a surgically treatable condition, ICP may be controlled by correcting the patient's position, temperature, ventilation or hemodynamics. If intracranial hypertension persists, drainage of CSF via external drainage is most effective. Other first-tier options include induced hypocapnea (hyperventilation; paCO2 < 35 mmHg), hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol, hypertonic saline) and induced arterial hypertension (CPP concept). When autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is compromised, hyperoncotic treatment aimed at reducing vasogenic edema and intracranial blood volume may be applied. When intracranial hypertension persists, second-tier treatments may be indicated. These include 'forced hyperventilation' (paCO2 < 25 mmHg), barbiturate coma or experimental protocols such as tris buffer, indomethacin or induced hypothermia. The last resort is emergent bilateral decompressive craniectomy; once taken into consideration, it should be performed without undue delay."

Pretreatment lymphopenia affected T cells (CD4, 150/microl; CD8, 459/microl), B cells (16/microl), and NK cells (55/microl). T cells were uniformly activated and largely apoptotic (CD4, 59%; CD8, 82%); and T-cell-dependent cytokine levels in plasma were elevated, including the levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2; 26 pg/ml), IL-4 (81 pg/ml), IL-5 (46 pg/ml), gamma interferon (1,430 pg/ml), tumor necrosis factor alpha (210 pg/ml), and IL-10 (168 pg/ml). Mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells show reduced IL-2 secretion and proliferation. During the first 5 months of therapy there was clinical improvement and partial immune reconstitution, with nearly normal lymphocyte subset numbers, reduced T-cell activation and CD4-cell apoptosis, and decreased plasma cytokine levels. In parallel, IL-2 secretion and the lymphocyte mitogenic response improved. Between 4 and 7 months, immunoglobulin G antibodies to bovine ADA developed and resulted in the complete reversal of immune recovery."
True,however administration parenteral ascorbic acid hours parenteral chromate experimental studies protect renal damage parenteral ascorbic acid given hours postparenteral chromate increased toxicity nan,10382555,ascorbic acid,toxicity,"Repeated topical exposure to chromium(VI) may cause an allergic contact dermatitis or the formation of chrome ulcers. Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III)."
False,bps providing supportive care reducing rate skeletal morbidity evidently abolishing criteria stopping administration different used classic antineoplastic drugs stopped metastatic bone disease progressingnan,12136223,BPs,bone disease,"Bisphosphonates (BPs) are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and it is well accepted that tumor cells in bone, especially breast cancer and myeloma cells, can stimulate osteoclast formation and activity leading to the release of growth factors or cytokines, which will further stimulate cancer cells' growth and their secretion of osteolytic factors. BPs are now the standard treatment for cancer hypercalcemia, for which a dose of 90 mg of pamidronate or 1500 mg of clodronate is recommended; the former compound is more potent and has a longer lasting effect. Repeated pamidronate infusions exert clinically relevant analgesic effects in more than half of patients with metastatic bone pain. Recent data suggest that non-responding patients should perhaps be treated with higher doses. The optimal dose actually remains to be defined, especially as it is thought that it is probably a function of the disease stage. Regular pamidronate infusions can also achieve a partial objective response according to conventional UICC criteria and they can almost double the objective response rate to chemotherapy. Lifelong administration of oral clodronate to patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone reduces the frequency of morbid skeletal events by more than one-fourth. Two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials comparing monthly 90 mg pamidronate infusions to placebo infusions for 1-2 years in addition to hormone or chemotherapy in patients with at least one lytic bone metastasis have shown that the mean skeletal morbidity rate could be reduced by 30-40%. The results obtained with intravenous BPs are generally viewed as better than those obtained with oral clodronate. However, preference can be given to the oral route when BPs are started early in the process of metastatic bone disease in a patient receiving hormone therapy. According to the recently published ASCO guidelines, pamidronate 90 mg i.v. delivered over 2 h every 3-4 weeks can be recommended in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have imaging evidence of lytic destruction of bone and who are concurrently receiving systemic therapy with hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Furthermore, the ASCO Panel considered it ""reasonable"" to start i.v. BPs in women with localized pain whose bone scans were abnormal and plain radiographs normal, but not when an abnormal bone scan is asymptomatic. The pertinence of these criteria is discussed below. Because BPs are providing supportive care, reducing the rate of skeletal morbidity but evidently not abolishing it, the criteria for stopping their administration have to be different from those used for classic antineoplastic drugs, and they should not be stopped when metastatic bone disease is progressing. However, criteria to determine whether and for how long an individual patient benefits from their administration are lacking. New biochemical markers of bone resorption might help identify those patients continuing to benefit from therapy. Even better results have been achieved in patients with multiple myeloma, and the general consensus is that BPs should be started as soon as the diagnosis of lytic disease is made in myeloma patients. On the other hand, data are scanty in prostate cancer, but large-scale trials with potent BPs are ongoing or planned in such patients. Similar results to those achieved with pamidronate have been obtained with monthly 6-mg infusions of the newer BP ibandronate in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone. The tolerance of ibandronate could be better, and the drug has the potential to be administered as a 15- to 30-min infusion. Zoledronate can also be administered safely as a 15-min 4-mg infusion, and large scale phase III trials have just been completed. These newer BPs will simplify the current therapeutic schemes and improve the cost-effectiveness ratio; they also have the potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy, at least in patients with an aggressive osteolytic disease or when given as adjuvant therapy. For that matter, initial data with clodronate indicate that they have the potential to prevent the development of bone metastases, but the use of BPs in the adjuvant setting must still be viewed as experimental."
True,degree nicotine induced nausea significantly correlated postural imbalancenan,17990061,nicotine,nausea,"Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."

We present the case of a 32 year-old man who was involved in a road traffic accident in which he suffered a severe head injury. Four days following the trauma the patient developed post-traumatic central diabetes insipidus and desmopressin was started. At discharge of the intensive care unit, the patient was referred to us for endocrine assessment. Three months after the head injury, the hormonal evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by means of insulin stress test with the simultaneous administration of TRH and GnRH resulted in reduced responses of GH, cortisol, TSH, FSH, and LH with low baseline serum concentrations of free T4 and testosterone. Both serum basal and stimulated PRL concentrations were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated deformity of the sella turcica with displacement of the pituitary gland by a post-traumatic retention cyst. A new evaluation of the pituitary function performed 6 months after the trauma showed spontaneous recovery of the gonadal, thyroid and adrenal function. However, GH response was reduced both to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, clonidine and GHRH tests. Presence of normal serum PRL levels, normal PRL response to TRH and reduced GH responses to pituitary and hypothalamic stimuli suggests both hypothalamic and pituitary damage. The present case shows an unusual case of partial spontaneous resolution of a post-traumatic hypopituitarism. Based on this clinical observation we recommend periodic evaluation of the pituitary function in these kind of patients."

True,low dose aspirin asa use associated wide range adverse side effects upper gastrointestinal gi tract range troublesome symptoms without mucosal lesions serious toxicity including ulcers gi bleeding perforation even deathnan,22542152,aspirin,toxicity,"Low dose aspirin (ASA) use has been associated with a wide range of adverse side effects in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which range from troublesome symptoms without mucosal lesions to more serious toxicity, including ulcers, GI bleeding, perforation and even death. Upper GI symptoms in low dose ASA users are common but often careless or misinterpreted and they are not always related to the presence of mucosal injury. Usually, low dose ASA related ulcers are reasonably small and asymptomatic, and probably heal over a period of weeks to a few months. But, the real clinical problem occurs when the ulcer results in a GI complication (mostly bleeding). The estimated average excess risk of symptomatic or complicated ulcer related to low dose ASA is five cases per 1000 ASA users per year. Death is the worst outcome of GI complications in low dose ASA users, but data about this aspect are scarce. Current evidence indicates that low dose ASA can damage the lower GI tract also, but the real size of the problem is still unknown."

A 54-year-old male patient diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection was prescribed oral roxithromycin 150 mg twice daily for 7 days. On the 10th day, the patient was admitted to the emergency with sore throat, redness, watering of eyes, painful micturition, and severe skin lesions. The skin lesions were multiple, severely painful, burning, coalesced, and filled with fluid-producing large blisters appearing on the lip, face, and trunk and then gradually spreading to legs, arms, palms, hands, and feet extensively involving much >30% of body surface area. Clinical examination, blood investigation, and histopathological examination of the skin confirmed the diagnosis of TEN. There was no history of any concomitant medications, drug allergy, burn injury, recent graft, or transplant or any coexisting infections such as herpes simplex. Other resembling skin diseases were eliminated after proper dermatological examination. This episode of TEN was probably drug (roxithromycin) induced. The drug was immediately stopped, and the patient was treated meticulously resulting in gradual reversal of the diseased state. Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale suggested the likelihood that oral administration of roxithromycin was responsible for the TEN was 'probable.'"

The acute rejection rate was lower (19% vs. 43%; P < 0.05) in patients achieving CsA C2 target range during the first week (1600-2000 microg/l), n = 26, compared with those who did not, n = 42. Median MPA concentration was 0.9 and 1.2 microg/ml in patients within or below C2 range, respectively (P = 0.19). CsA C2 correlated with MPAG-to-MPA ratio (P < 0.01, r = 0.91) and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT, P < 0.01, r = 0.86). Total MPA concentration increased during the 3 months, but not in patients on tacrolimus. High CsA C2 lowered the acute rejection rate and plasma MPA. High CsA C2 is associated with elevated GGT, probably because of cholestatic effects, which explain the increased MPAG-to-MPA ratio. Increasing MPA concentration is ascribed to per-protocol CsA C2 reductions. In conclusion, CsA may confound the relationship between MPA and the incidence of rejection, and contribute to the difficulty of obtaining a therapeutic range for MPA in clinical practice."

True,differences er stressinduced apoptosis human hepatoma cells normal human hepatocyte investigated exposure tunicamycin er stress inducernan,22225575,tunicamycin,hepatoma,"Endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated cell apoptosis is implicated in the development of cancer. Melatonin induces apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in experimental studies, but the effects of melatonin on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis in HCC have not been tested. Differences in ER stress-induced apoptosis in human hepatoma cells and normal human hepatocyte were investigated by exposure to tunicamycin (ER stress inducer). Significant differences were observed in the rate of apoptosis between HepG2 cells (hepatoma cells) and HL-7702 cells (normal human hepatocyte cells). The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was increased in HepG2 cells but not in HL-7702 cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of COX-2 expression using the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, increased tunicamycin-induced apoptosis concomitant with the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP (GADD153) and down-regulation of B-cell lymphoma 2/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bcl-2/Bax) ratio, suggesting that inhibition of COX-2 sensitized human hepatoma cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, co-treatment with tunicamycin and melatonin also decreased the expression of COX-2 and significantly increased the rate of apoptosis by elevating the levels of CHOP and reducing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. These results demonstrate that melatonin sensitizes human hepatoma cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis by down-regulating COX-2 expression, increasing the levels of CHOP and decreasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio."

To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of CS, gamma-cholesteryloxybutyric acid, tris salt (CSE) against acetaminophen-, adriamycin-, carbon tetrachloride-, chloroform- and galactosamine-induced toxicity. The results of these studies demonstrated that CS-mediated protection is not selective for a particular species, organ system or toxic chemical. A 24-h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS (100mg/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4, CHCl3, acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal (and presumably cardiotoxic) effect of adriamycin administration. Maximal CS-mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult. These data suggest that CS intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death. The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity). However, based on the data presented, we can not exclude the possibility that CS administration inhibits chemical bioactivation. Our findings do suggest that CS-mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic CS molecule (non-hydrolyzable CSE was as protective as CS), whose mechanism has yet to be defined."

Thus, hyperammonemia is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with liver disease. Experiments in vitro showed that acetylcholine-induced catecholamine release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50% by 0.3 mM NH4Ac and KCl-induced contractions of guinea-pig ileum were inhibited 20% by 5 mM NH4Ac. Addition of excess calcium reversed the depression in both tissues, but calcium-independent catecholamine release by acetaldehyde was not blocked by NH4Ac. These results suggested that ammonia blocks calcium channels. Parallels in the actions of NH4Ac and the calcium channel blocker verapamil support this concept. Both verapamil (10 mg/kg i.p.) and NH4Ac pretreatment enhanced morphine analgesia- and diazepam-induced muscular incoordination and antagonized amphetamine-induced motor activity, and neither verapamil nor NH4Ac affected the convulsant action of metrazol. The data suggest that hyperammonemia exerts a calcium channel blocking action which enhances the effects of central nervous system depressants and certain opioid analgesics."

True,moreover alcohol abuse produce cardiac arrhythmias hypertension cardiomyopathy stroke even sudden death nan,9751945,alcohol,sudden death,"The ingestion of one or two alcoholic drinks can affect heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, myocardial contractility, and regional blood flow. These actions generally are not clinically important. In the presence of cardiovascular disease, however, even such small quantities of alcohol might result in transient unfavorable hemodynamic changes. Moreover, alcohol abuse can produce cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, stroke, and even sudden death. In contrast, moderate alcohol use produces changes that have an overall favorable effect on atherosclerotic-related vascular diseases. Because cardiovascular disease due to atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in Western society, this desirable effect of alcohol use outweighs its detrimental actions, resulting in favorable findings in population studies. Nevertheless, the body of evidence argues against encouraging alcohol use for its cardiovascular effects."
False,possible drug interaction occurred yearold woman taking cisapride gastroesophageal reflux disorder diltiazem agent inhibitory effect cypa hypertensionnan,9545159,diltiazem,gastroesophageal reflux disorder,"Cisapride, a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrate, is widely prescribed for the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders. Prolongation of QT interval, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents, but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem, an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for hypertension. The patient was in near syncope and had QT-interval prolongation. After discontinuing cisapride, the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur. We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, including diltiazem."
False,therapy systemic lupus erythematosus antimalarial drugs chloroquine hydroxychloroquine quinacrine used long timenan,21398612,chloroquine,systemic lupus erythematosus,"Endosomal TLRs play an important role in innate immune response as well as in autoimmune processes. In the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus, antimalarial drugs chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and quinacrine have been used for a long time. Their suppression of endosomal TLR activation has been attributed to the inhibition of endosomal acidification, which is a prerequisite for the activation of these receptors. We discovered that chloroquine inhibits only activation of endosomal TLRs by nucleic acids, whereas it augments activation of TLR8 by a small synthetic compound, R848. We detected direct binding of antimalarials to nucleic acids by spectroscopic experiments and determined their cellular colocalization. Further analysis revealed that other nucleic acid-binding compounds, such as propidium iodide, also inhibited activation of endosomal TLRs and colocalized with nucleic acids to endosomes. We found that imidazoquinolines, which are TLR7/8 agonists, inhibit TLR9 and TLR3 even in the absence of TLR7 or TLR8, and their mechanism of inhibition is similar to the antimalarials. In contrast to bafilomycin, none of the tested antimalarials and imidazoquinolines inhibited endosomal proteolysis or increased the endosomal pH, confirming that inhibition of pH acidification is not the underlying cause of inhibition. We conclude that the direct binding of inhibitors to nucleic acids mask their TLR-binding epitope and may explain the efficiency of those compounds in the treatment of autoimmune diseases."

In the present work, extracts of 12 selected herbs were prepared with methanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate and water, and the effects of these on the multidrug resistance (MDR) and P-glycoprotein of mouse lymphoma cells transfected with the human mdr1 gene and on a human lung alveolar epithelial cell line were investigated. The extracts were tested for antiproliferative effects, and the reversal of MDR in mouse lymphoma cells. The possible chemopreventive effect of the chloroform extracts was studied on the expression of cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early (IE) antigen in human lung cancer cells (A549). The antimicrobial effects of the extracts were tested on some representative micro-organisms. Certain of the chloroform extracts of the plant materials were the most effective compounds on the reversal of MDR. Two of the chloroform extracts enhanced the antiproliferative effect of doxorubicin on MDR mouse lymphoma cells. The selected extracts did not show any antibacterial effect with the agar diffusion method. Certain chloroform extracts decreased the intermediate IE antigen expression of CMV in A459 cells."
True,serotonin syndrome venlafaxine tranylcypromine interactionnan,8888541,venlafaxine,Serotonin syndrome,"Excessive stimulation of serotonin 5HT1A receptors causes a syndrome of serotonin excess that consists of shivering, muscle rigidity, salivation, confusion, agitation and hyperthermia. The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. We report a venlafaxine-MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23-y-old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression. He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1/2 tab of venlafaxine. Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities, tremors and rigidity. He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering, myoclonic jerks, rigidity, salivation and diaphoresis. His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light. Vital signs were: blood pressure 120/67 mm Hg, heart rate 127/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and temperature 97 F. After 180 mg of diazepam i.v. he remained tremulous with muscle rigidity and clenched jaws. He was intubated for airway protection and because of hypoventilation, and was paralyzed to control muscle rigidity. His subsequent course was remarkable for non-immune thrombocytopenia which resolved. The patient's maximal temperature was 101.2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units/L with no other evidence of rhabdomyolysis. His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward. This patient survived without sequelae due to the aggressive sedation and neuromuscular paralysis."

Prompted by a case of clozapine-related pericarditis in an adolescent, we undertook a retrospective chart review to discover whether any unrecognized cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy were among the children, adolescents, and young adults we had treated with clozapine. The sample comprised a total of 36 patients, who were monitored regularly over a period ranging from 2.5 to 79 months. The average observation period was 7.5 months. Patients were assessed for potential indicators of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. In more than 66% of all patients, at least one of several parameters potentially indicative of pericarditis, myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy was abnormal in at least one instance during the observation period. In all cases in which abnormalities were discovered, the abnormalities were found to be unspecific for myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. With the exception of the case which prompted our study, none of the patients were found to have developed any such disorder in the course of further treatment with clozapine."

Clinical manifestations of this disorder include hemorrhage or, more frequently, thromboembolic events in patients receiving heparin. Laboratory testing has revealed a falling platelet count, increased resistance to heparin, and aggregation of platelets by the patient's plasma when heparin is added. Immunologic testing has demonstrated the presence of a heparin-dependent platelet membrane antibody. The 20 deaths, 52 hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications, and 21 surgical procedures to manage the complications confirm the seriousness of the disorder. Specific risk factors have not been identified; therefore, all patients receiving heparin should be monitored. If the platelet count falls to less than 100,000/mm3, while the patient is receiving heparin, platelet aggregation testing, using the patient's plasma, is indicated. Management consists of cessation of heparin, platelet anti-aggregating agents, and alternate forms of anticoagulation when indicated."
True,ototoxic effect exposure styrene evaluated also presence simultaneous exposure noise using otoacoustic emissions biomarkers mild cochlear damagenan,24180784,styrene,ototoxic,"The ototoxic effect of the exposure to styrene is evaluated, also in the presence of simultaneous exposure to noise, using otoacoustic emissions as biomarkers of mild cochlear damage. Transient-evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were recorded and analyzed in a sample of workers (15 subjects) exposed to styrene and noise in a fiberglass manufacturing facility and in a control group of 13 non-exposed subjects. Individual exposure monitoring of the airborne styrene concentrations was performed, as well as biological monitoring, based on the urinary concentration of two styrene metabolites, the Mandelic and Phenylglyoxylic acids. Noise exposure was evaluated using wearable phonometers, and hearing loss with pure tone audiometry. Due to their different job tasks, one group of workers was exposed to high noise and low styrene levels, another group to higher styrene levels, close to the limit of 20 ppm, and to low noise levels. A significant negative correlation was found between the otoacoustic emission levels and the concentration of the styrene urinary metabolites. Otoacoustic emissions, and particularly distortion products, were able to discriminate the exposed workers from the controls, providing also a rough estimate of the slope of the dose-response relation between otoacoustic levels and styrene exposure.

False,lack evidence bodyweight gain ziprasidone considerable advantagenan,11772153,ziprasidone,bodyweight gain,"Antipsychotics are frequently used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Atypical antipsychotics have come to the forefront in child psychiatry due largely to their tolerability profiles as well as their efficacy. Potential treatment options include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. A number of studies investigating the use of clozapine have been published in children; however, owing to the frequent monitoring required for agranulocytosis, the use of clozapine may be restricted to patients with treatment-refractory disease. With accumulating data on the development of glucose intolerance in adults receiving clozapine, closer monitoring of bodyweight and fasting blood glucose is imperative. Clozapine also has an increased seizure risk, therefore a baseline electroencephalogram should be performed, as well as continued vigilance for this adverse effect. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that is generally well tolerated and numerous studies have been published investigating this drug in children. Unlike clozapine, its receptor interaction profile lends itself toward increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinaemia. Bodyweight gain is a common adverse effect, although somewhat less than that reported with olanzapine. Baseline liver function studies prior to initiation of this medication are recommended. Risperidone-induced mania has been reported in adults and, therefore, increased caution should be used when deciding to treat children and adolescents with risperidone, particularly in those with a predisposition toward mania. Olanzapine, like risperidone, has also been associated with onset of mania in adults. Olanzapine has a receptor profile that results in significant risk for bodyweight gain and sedation. Furthermore, this drug has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance; thus, it is important to monitor bodyweight and fasting blood glucose on a frequent basis. Less information is known about quetiapine in children and adolescents. Reports about its efficacy and tolerability vary. Quetiapine appears to have increased risk for sedation and bodyweight gain, albeit less than that of olanzapine. The compound appears to be less likely to induce EPS. Finally, ziprasidone has recently been approved for use in the adult population. This compound, in terms of its receptor profile, has more in common with risperidone. This suggests a potential for increased risk of EPS and hyperprolactinaemia. It also has an increased risk of QTc prolongation; thus, a baseline electrocardiogram is suggested, particularly in those patients with a history of cardiovascular illness. Lack of evidence for bodyweight gain with ziprasidone is a considerable advantage."

True,ras erk signaling pathway involved curcumin induced cell cycle arrest apoptosis human gastric carcinoma ags cellsnan,25492214,curcumin,Ras,"Curcumin, the biologically active compound from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, could inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in gastric carcinoma. However, the underlying mechanism of curcumin on gastric carcinoma cells still needs further investigation. In this study, morphological observation indicated that curcumin inhibited the proliferation of AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner. According to the flow cytometric analysis, curcumin treatment resulted in G2/M arrest in AGS cells, accompanied with an increased expression of cyclin B1 and a decreased expression of cyclin D1. In addition, DNA ladders were observed by gel electrophoresis. Meanwhile, the activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9 were also enhanced in curcumin-treated AGS cells. Nevertheless, the increased activities could be inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OME)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), which suggested that the apoptosis was caspase-dependent. Furthermore, downregulation of rat sarcoma (Ras) and upregulation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were also observed in AGS cells treated with curcumin by Western blot. U0126, an ERK inhibitor, blocked curcumin-induced apoptosis. The results suggested that curcumin inhibited the growth of the AGS cells and induced apoptosis through the activation of Ras/ERK signaling pathway and downstream caspase cascade, and curcumin might be a potential target for the treatment of gastric carcinoma.

False,according recently published asco guidelines pamidronate mg iv delivered every weeks recommended patients metastatic breast cancer imaging evidence lytic destruction bone concurrently receiving systemic therapy hormonal therapy chemotherapynan,12136223,pamidronate,breast cancer,"Bisphosphonates (BPs) are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and it is well accepted that tumor cells in bone, especially breast cancer and myeloma cells, can stimulate osteoclast formation and activity leading to the release of growth factors or cytokines, which will further stimulate cancer cells' growth and their secretion of osteolytic factors. BPs are now the standard treatment for cancer hypercalcemia, for which a dose of 90 mg of pamidronate or 1500 mg of clodronate is recommended; the former compound is more potent and has a longer lasting effect. Repeated pamidronate infusions exert clinically relevant analgesic effects in more than half of patients with metastatic bone pain. Recent data suggest that non-responding patients should perhaps be treated with higher doses. The optimal dose actually remains to be defined, especially as it is thought that it is probably a function of the disease stage. Regular pamidronate infusions can also achieve a partial objective response according to conventional UICC criteria and they can almost double the objective response rate to chemotherapy. Lifelong administration of oral clodronate to patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone reduces the frequency of morbid skeletal events by more than one-fourth. Two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials comparing monthly 90 mg pamidronate infusions to placebo infusions for 1-2 years in addition to hormone or chemotherapy in patients with at least one lytic bone metastasis have shown that the mean skeletal morbidity rate could be reduced by 30-40%. The results obtained with intravenous BPs are generally viewed as better than those obtained with oral clodronate. However, preference can be given to the oral route when BPs are started early in the process of metastatic bone disease in a patient receiving hormone therapy. According to the recently published ASCO guidelines, pamidronate 90 mg i.v. delivered over 2 h every 3-4 weeks can be recommended in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have imaging evidence of lytic destruction of bone and who are concurrently receiving systemic therapy with hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Furthermore, the ASCO Panel considered it ""reasonable"" to start i.v. BPs in women with localized pain whose bone scans were abnormal and plain radiographs normal, but not when an abnormal bone scan is asymptomatic. The pertinence of these criteria is discussed below. Because BPs are providing supportive care, reducing the rate of skeletal morbidity but evidently not abolishing it, the criteria for stopping their administration have to be different from those used for classic antineoplastic drugs, and they should not be stopped when metastatic bone disease is progressing. However, criteria to determine whether and for how long an individual patient benefits from their administration are lacking. New biochemical markers of bone resorption might help identify those patients continuing to benefit from therapy. Even better results have been achieved in patients with multiple myeloma, and the general consensus is that BPs should be started as soon as the diagnosis of lytic disease is made in myeloma patients. On the other hand, data are scanty in prostate cancer, but large-scale trials with potent BPs are ongoing or planned in such patients. Similar results to those achieved with pamidronate have been obtained with monthly 6-mg infusions of the newer BP ibandronate in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone. The tolerance of ibandronate could be better, and the drug has the potential to be administered as a 15- to 30-min infusion. Zoledronate can also be administered safely as a 15-min 4-mg infusion, and large scale phase III trials have just been completed. These newer BPs will simplify the current therapeutic schemes and improve the cost-effectiveness ratio; they also have the potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy, at least in patients with an aggressive osteolytic disease or when given as adjuvant therapy. For that matter, initial data with clodronate indicate that they have the potential to prevent the development of bone metastases, but the use of BPs in the adjuvant setting must still be viewed as experimental."

True,rings endothelial function attenuated enzymatic treatment 5-ht caused contractions log ec partially blocked ketanserinnan,8789380,5-HT,contractions,"1. We investigated the hypothesis that, as in some other large human arteries, 5-HT-induced contraction of the temporal artery is mediated through two co-existing receptor populations, 5-HT1-like- and 5-HT2A. Temporal arterial segments were obtained from patients undergoing brain surgery and rings prepared set up to contract with 5-HT and related agents. Fractions of maximal 5-HT responses mediated through 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2A receptors, f1 and f2 = 1-f1, were estimated by use of the 5-HT2A-selective antagonist ketanserin. 2. In rings with intact endothelium 5-HT evoked contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.0. Ketanserin (10-1000 nM) antagonized part of the 5-HT-induced contractions. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M of 6.9 and f1 of 0.17 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 6.4 and f1 of 0.20 (1000 nM ketanserin). 3. In rings with endothelial function attenuated by enzymatic treatment, 5-HT caused contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.2 that were partially blocked by ketanserin. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M 7.4 and f1 of 0.16 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 7.5 and f1 of 0.14 (1000 nM ketanserin). 4. The ketanserin-resistant component of 5-HT-evoked contraction was blocked by methiothepin (100-1000 nM) consistent with mediation through 5-HT1-like receptors. 5. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT1-like-selective agonist, sumatriptan, caused small contractions with a -log EC50, M of 6.5 and intrinsic activity of 0.21 with respect to 5-HT that were resistant to blockade by 1000 nM ketanserin but antagonized by 100 nM methiothepin. 6. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT2A receptor partial agonist SK&F 103829 (2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-8[methyl sulphonyl]-1H3-benzazepin-7-ol methensulphonate) contracted rings with a -log EC50, M of 5.0 and an intrinsic activity of 0.49 with respect to 5-HT; the effects were antagonized by ketanserin 1000 nM. 7. We conclude that 80-86% of the maximum 5-HT-evoked contraction of human temporal artery is mediated through 5-HT2A receptors, the remainder through 5-HT1-like-receptors, regardless of whether or not endothelium is functional. The 5-HT1-like-receptors are more likely to be 5-HT1D beta receptors than 5-HT1D alpha receptors and sumatriptan is a full agonist for these receptors. As found in arteries of other species, SK&F 103829 is a partial agonist for 5-HT2A receptors of human temporal artery."

Paclitaxel might thus be effective in eliminating radioresistant clones from cervical tumors, even in the absence of synergistic interaction between these therapeutic modalities. We thus established the relationship between Raf-1 kinase activity and radiosensitivity in human cervical tumor cells and determined if paclitaxel is preferentially cytotoxic to radio-resistant tumor clones."
True,electron microscopy revealed dosedependent ultrastructural alterations marked mitochondrial damage nontransgenic mice treated adr transgenic littermatesnan,8787689,ADR,mitochondrial damage,"Adriamycin (ADR) is a potent anticancer drug known to cause severe cardiac toxicity. Although ADR generates free radicals, the role of free radicals in the development of cardiac toxicity and the intracellular target for ADR-induced cardiac toxicity are still not well understood. We produced three transgenic mice lines expressing increased levels of human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial enzyme, as an animal model to investigate the role of ADR-mediated free radical generation in mitochondria. The human MnSOD was expressed, functionally active, and properly transported into mitochondria in the heart of transgenic mice. The levels of copper-zinc SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase did not change in the transgenic mice. Electron microscopy revealed dose-dependent ultrastructural alterations with marked mitochondrial damage in nontransgenic mice treated with ADR, but not in the transgenic littermates. Biochemical analysis indicated that the levels of serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in ADR-treated mice were significantly greater in nontransgenic than their transgenic littermates expressing a high level of human MnSOD after ADR treatment. These results support a major role for free radical generation in ADR toxicity as well as suggesting mitochondria as the critical site of cardiac injury."

We herein present a case of PRES that occurred after 33 days of high-dose bortezomib treatment and propose both overwhelmed cerebral autoregulation and toxin-mediated blood-brain barrier damage as the underlying mechanisms based on the imaging findings. A favorable recovery was observed two days after achieving stringent hypertension control and withholding bortezomib. Follow-up images obtained two weeks later unveiled a dramatic remission, with faint areas of subcortical hyperintensity in the bilateral parieto-occipital regions. With explicit clinical and imaging features, this case highlights the need for early recognition of PRES during the clinical course of bortezomib therapy. "

True,vitro studies showed 12(s)-hete shete treatment resulted concentrationdependent increase adhesion bf cells collagen fibronectinnan,23664097,12(S)-HETE,adhesion,"12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) is a non-haeme iron-containing dioxygenase that forms 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) or 15(S)-HETE. Several biological mediators including cytokines, growth factors and lipid metabolites released during tumour cell-endothelial cell adhesion are associated with malignant tumour progression. Here we found that HETEs released from the host organ played a critical role in tumour metastasis. Intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma cells caused lung nodule formation, which was markedly attenuated in 12/15-LOX null mice. Co-injection of melanoma cells with 12(S)-HETE increased the lung homing activity of B16F10 melanoma cells. In vitro studies showed that 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent increase of adhesion of B16F10 cells on collagen or fibronectin. The melanoma cell adhesion was then evaluated in pulmonary primary cell culture isolated from wild-type (WT) and 12/15-LOX knockout (KO) mice. It was found that the adhesion of melanoma cells on the epithelial cells isolated from 12/15-LOX null mice was reduced in comparison with those isolated from WT mice. Treatment of 12(S)-HETE increased the pFAK in melanoma cells adhering on collagen-coated slide. The enhancement of adherence elicited by 12(S)-HETE in B16F10 cells could be antagonised by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor 14 (FAK inhibitor) or PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor). 12(S)-HETE increased the phosphorylation of FAK and ERK in adhering melanoma cells. The FAK phosphorylation induced by 12(S)-HETE was further inhibited by PD98059, indicating that FAK is the downstream target of ERK. The adhesion and lung metastasis of human melanoma cells of C32 in NOD/SCID mice were also potentiated by co-treatment with 12(S)-HETE. These results demonstrate that 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE activates ERK and FAK signalling pathways, thereby upregulates the adhesion and metastatic potential of melanoma cells. The endogenous release of 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE in the host organ may affect the metastatic potential of melanoma. "

True,suggested criteria include use patients would otherwise candidates oral fluoroquinolone therapy published criteria exist cannot use oral route administration due gastrointestinal conditions predisposing malabsorption unavailability oral route severe infections due gramnegative pathogens replacement aminoglycosides ototoxicity nephrotoxicity substantial risk targeting resistant pathogens ie empiric therapy targeting therapeutic use prophylaxisnan,8474940,aminoglycosides,ototoxicity,"The basic tenet of pharmaceutical care asserts that the delivery of optimal, cost-effective pharmacotherapy can be best achieved by identifying, resolving, and preventing drug-related problems. Drug use evaluation (DUE) is one of the primary tools used to achieve these ends. Fluoroquinolone antimicrobials meet Joint Commission criteria for targeting for DUE: the drugs are used in populations at high risk for adverse drug reactions, quality assurance or infection control committees target them for DUE, the drugs are costly, they may be suspected or known to be used inappropriately, and they are prescribed frequently. Outside this supplement, no published DUE criteria for parenteral fluoroquinolones currently exist. Suggested criteria include use in patients who would otherwise be candidates for oral fluoroquinolone therapy (for which published criteria exist) but who cannot use the oral route of administration due to gastrointestinal conditions predisposing to malabsorption or unavailability of the oral route; for severe infections due to gram-negative pathogens; as a replacement for aminoglycosides when ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity is a substantial risk; targeting to resistant pathogens (i.e., not as empiric therapy); and targeting to therapeutic use only (not for prophylaxis). The DUE process is crucial for ensuring safe, effective, appropriate, and economical drug therapy. It is an effective mechanism for evaluating the use of new agents and as an educational tool for clinicians in the postmarketing period."
True,changes peroxisomes preneoplastic liver hepatoma mice induced alphabenzene hexachloride nan,85485,alpha-benzene hexachloride,hepatoma,"Peroxisomes in hepatomas and hyperplastic preneoplastic liver lesions induced in mice by 500 ppm alpha-benzene hexachloride were examined histochemically and electron microscopically. Although most of the hepatomas were well-differentiated tumors and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes, the tumor cells did not respond to ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate with proliferation of peroxisomes. At the 16th week of carcinogen feeding, hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages. A majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes. Within the nodules, foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared. These cells proliferated further, replacing the most part of the nodules, and with this process hepatomas appeared to have been formed. No abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate unlike in the case of rats."

True,relative ingestion sucrose maltitol caused significant difference symptoms resulted mild borborygmi flatulencenan,9482768,maltitol,flatulence,"Little is known about the gastrointestinal effects of ingesting maltitol in chocolate. This study was designed to determine whether it leads to increased gastrointestinal symptomatology and if that symptomatology is dose related. It was also designed to discover whether breath hydrogen excretion in response to maltitol is dose related. In a double-blind, crossover study, 20 healthy volunteers aged 18-24 y ingested 100 g chocolate containing 40 g sucrose, 10 g sucrose plus 30 g maltitol or 40 g maltitol after fasting (abstinence from food and liquids from 2200 h on the night before chocolate consumption) and not fasting. There was no difference in symptomatology between fasting and nonfasting periods, and consumption order had no effect on symptomatology. Relative to ingestion of sucrose, 30 g maltitol caused no significant difference in symptoms, but 40 g resulted in more mild borborygmi (P < 0.05) and mild flatulence (P < 0.01) but not moderate or severe symptoms. Neither 30 nor 40 g maltitol caused significantly greater laxation than sucrose ingestion (P > 0.05). In a separate study, 10 healthy volunteers aged 18-24 y ate the same test products before breath H2 testing; 40 g maltitol in chocolate caused a greater total breath H2 excretion compared with 30 g maltitol (P < 0.05) or sucrose (P < 0.01). Total breath hydrogen excretion was also greater with 30 g maltitol compared with sucrose (P < 0.05). This dose-related response was consistent with the lower symptomatology after ingestion of 30 vs. 40 g maltitol. We have shown that 30 g maltitol in chocolate causes no significant symptomatology in young adults; however, 40 g caused mild borborygmi and flatus but no increased laxation. An increased breath H2 response indicates colonic fermentation of this polyol."

True,although pcp classified human carcinogen epidemiological observations suggest exposure chlorophenols general pcp solutions particular may result increased risk certain malignant disorders nasal carcinoma soft tissue sarcoma nan,7904464,chlorophenols,sarcoma,"Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was, and still is, one of the most frequently used fungicides and pesticides. Its toxicity is due to interference with oxidative phosphorylation. Acute and chronic poisoning may occur by dermal absorption, inhalation or ingestion. Chronic poisoning occurs mainly in sawmill workers or people living in log homes treated with PCP-containing wood protecting formulations. Quantitative determination of PCP in urine and serum is useful to detect occupational or subclinical exposure. The clinical features of acute and chronic PCP poisoning can be classified systematically into effects on the skin, metabolism (fever), the haematopoietic tissue, the respiratory system, the central and peripheral nervous system, the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract. Although PCP is not classified as a human carcinogen, some epidemiological observations suggest that exposure to chlorophenols in general and PCP solutions in particular may result in an increased risk for certain malignant disorders such as nasal carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma. There is concern that contamination of PCP-solutions with products such as chlorodibenzo-p-dioxins is the real cause of this suspected carcinogenicity. No specific antidote exists for the treatment of (acute) PCP poisoning. The basis of the treatment of acute poisoning is intensive supportive care with prevention of dangerous rise in temperature. Use of PCP-based products as indoor wood preservatives poses an unacceptable risk to human health."
True,pretreatment reserpine mgkg observation test produced increases vacuous chewing movements tongue protrusion well increases tremor catalepsy whereas mk-801 mgkg injection min test reversed effects reserpine giving reserpine hours prior caused tremor,11999899,reserpine,tremor,"The effects of dizocilpine (MK-801), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, were studied on dopamine-related behaviors induced by reserpine treatments. This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for Parkinson's disease, or tardive dyskinesia, and its response after glutamatergic blockage. Reserpine (1 mg/kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia, tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia. Reserpine also produced tremor and catalepsy, which are signs suggestive of Parkinson's disease. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by reserpine. However, MK-801 injection produced a significant increase of tremor in reserpine-treated mice. Reserpine (1 mg/kg), administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection (0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before the test, did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice. On the other hand, reserpine induced increases in tremor and catalepsy compared to control mice. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) administration attenuated the catalepsy and tremor induced by reserpine. Pretreatment with reserpine (1 mg/kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in tremor and catalepsy, whereas MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of reserpine. These results show that reserpine produces different and abnormal movements, which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as parkinsonian-like and tardive dsykinesia signs. The glutamatergic blockage produced by NMDA can restore these signs, such as vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions, catalepsy and tremor according to the employed model."

Wistar rats (180 g) were treated by DEN alone or by DEN + PB during 2, 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis. After the end of the treatment, the number and the size of induced PAS positive preneoplastic foci was significantly reduced when PB was given simultaneously with DEN for 4 and 6 weeks. The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in DEN treated rats were also significantly decreased in DEN + PB treated rats. When the treatment last only 2 weeks, the presence of PB did not change significantly the last parameters. In DEN + PB treated rats, the survival was prolonged and the tumor incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by DEN alone. It is concluded that PB, which promotes carcinogenesis when administered after the DEN treatment, reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with DEN. This 'anti-carcinogen' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the precancerous lesions. Biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this 'paradoxical' PB effect."

The present review focuses on the several adverse health effects of acrylamide including mutagenicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, and the possible outcomes of childhood exposure from baby foods and infant formulas."
False,however administration parenteral ascorbic acid hours parenteral chromate experimental studies protect renal damage parenteral ascorbic acid given hours postparenteral chromate increased toxicitynan,10382555,ascorbic acid,renal damage,"Repeated topical exposure to chromium(VI) may cause an allergic contact dermatitis or the formation of chrome ulcers. Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III)."

ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which induce the differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 (two human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines) to myelocytic lineage, up-regulated these two enzymes with various degrees at 2 and 72 h of treatment. In HL-60 cells treated with ATRA, the increase of β3GnT-8 was more than β3GnT-2, while in NB4 cells treated with DMSO, the increase of β3GnT-2 was more than β3GnT-8. However, when HL-60 and NB4 were differentiated to monocytic lineage induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate the expressions of β3GnT-2 and β3GnT-8 showed no alterations or the increase of expressions was far less than those in myelocytic differentiation. By means of FITC-labeled tomato lectin affinity staining and flow-cytometry, it was found that the product of β3GnT-2 and -8, polyLacNAc was also increased on the cell surface of HL-60 and NB4 treated with ATRA or DMSO, but unchanged when treated with PMA. These results were in accordance with the up-regulation of the mRNAs of β3GnT-2 and -8. The expression of β3GnT-5, however, was not changed both in myelocytic and monocytic differentiations. The difference in the up-regulation of β3GnT-2 and -8, especially their products may become a useful index to discriminate the myelocytic and monocytic differentiation of leukemia cells."
False,terazosin maintained antihypertensive efficacy well tolerated patients variety concomitant diseases including congestive heart failure peripheral vascular disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease benign prostatic hyperplasia diabetes obesitynan,7923316,Terazosin,prostatic hyperplasia,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the alpha 1-blocking agent terazosin on blood pressure (BP) and blood lipids in a large, variant population of patients with hypertension. A total of 16,917 patients with hypertension were evaluated at 2214 primary and community care facilities; 7808 of these patients had not been treated previously for hypertension; 3928 were switched to terazosin from another antihypertensive agent; and 5181 received terazosin in addition to an agent that had not controlled their hypertension. Terazosin produced highly significant reductions in systolic (-18.2 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) and diastolic (-13.2 +/- 0.1 mm Hg) BP when used as monotherapy (mean dose, 3.1 mg; range, 2 to 10 mg) without causing a significant increase in heart rate. Equal antihypertensive efficacy was demonstrated in men, women, blacks, and whites of all ages, with particular benefit to elderly patients (> or = 65 years of age) with systolic hypertension. Comparative studies indicated that terazosin had equal antihypertensive efficacy in combination with diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Patients who had not responded to monotherapy with one of these classes of antihypertensive drugs showed significant reductions of BP after terazosin, in the following average doses, was added to diuretics, 3.1 mg; beta-blockers, 3.4 mg; calcium channel blockers, 3.3 mg; and ACE inhibitors, 3.4 mg. Terazosin produced highly significant reductions in blood levels of total cholesterol (-5.0%), triglycerides (-6.1%), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-7.6%) without change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy. Similar favorable effects on blood lipid levels were demonstrated when terazosin was used in combination with all other classes of antihypertensive drugs. The greatest reductions in blood cholesterol (-9.2%) were observed among patients with hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol > or = 240 mg/dL). Terazosin maintained its antihypertensive efficacy and was well tolerated by patients with a variety of concomitant diseases, including congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes, and obesity. Adverse effects occurred in 17.9% of patients and caused 2.2% to drop out of the study. The most frequent adverse effects were dizziness (4.8%), headache (2.5%), and asthenia (2.4%). Only 0.4% suffered syncope and 0.2% impotence. These data demonstrate the usefulness of terazosin as monotherapy or add-on therapy for treatment of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
True,epothilones new class mti may associated grade peripheral neuropathy however neuropathy associated ixabepilone novel epothilone analog generally mild moderate reversible baseline grade levelsnan,18567992,ixabepilone,neuropathy,"Microtubule inhibitor (MTI)-based chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer--including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones--are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone."

False,data suggest clonal abnormalities observed posttransplant best explained clinical relapse tumor ex vivo marrow purging 4-hc likely induce clonal chromosome abnormalities normal cellsnan,8453599,4-HC,marrow purging,"Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) offers potentially curative therapy for patients with acute leukemia and lymphoma, yet little information exists about the chromosome abnormalities observed in ABMT recipients. Clonal abnormalities of chromosome 1 were reported by van den Akker. We report the cytogenetic results of 55 patients who underwent ABMT between November 1987 and July 1990: acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL, 22), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, eight), Hodgkin's disease (seven), lymphoma (16), other (two). ANLL patients received busulfan and cytoxan, and the others received cytoxan and total body irradiation as their preparative regimen before transplant. BM was purged ex vivo with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) at 30-100 micrograms/ml before reinfusion to kill tumor cells. Cytogenetic analysis was performed before and after transplant. Between one and four posttransplant specimens of BM were analyzed per patient (range 36-921 days). Chromosome abnormalities were observed in 14 of 55 patients after transplant. Seven had clonal abnormalities; all were in leukemic relapse, and one karyotype had complex rearrangements. Clonal abnormalities of chromosome 1 were not observed. Seven patients had nonclonal changes, and three of these have had overt clinical relapse. Our data suggest that clonal abnormalities observed posttransplant are best explained by clinical relapse of tumor and that ex vivo marrow purging with 4-HC is not likely to induce clonal chromosome abnormalities in normal cells. Long-term observation of these patients will be required to answer that question definitively, however."

Current approaches to surveillance are often inadequate to detect myocardial disease. Strain imaging might detect earlier myocardial dysfunction. Speckle analysis of three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography improves information about left ventricular (LV) segmental and global deformation by avoiding the loss of speckles seen in monoplane bidimensional-strain analysis. We assessed whether early 3D-strain analysis could predict later anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity."

Several reports have linked the abuse of PPA with myocardial injury, especially when overdose is involved. We report here the first case of Dexatrim (PPA)-induced myocardial injury in a young woman who was using it at recommended doses for weight control. In addition, we review the 7 other cases of PPA related myocardial injury that have been reported so far.

Patients had tumours that failed or progressed after first-line platinum-containing regimens for advanced or metastatic disease, or had progressive disease after platinum-containing chemotherapy given with adjuvant or neoadjuvant intent. Response and adverse events were assessed according to WHO criteria and NCI-CTC (version 2), respectively. Out of 51 patients treated with 320 mg m(-2) of vinflunine, nine patients responded to the therapy yielding an overall response rate of 18% (95% CI: 8.4-30.9%), and 67% (95%CI: 52.1-79.3%) achieved disease control (PR+SD). Of note, responses were seen in patients with relatively poor prognostic factors such as a short (<12 months) interval from prior platinum therapy (19%, including an 11% response rate in those progressing <3 months after platinum treatment), prior treatment for metastatic disease (24%), prior treatment with vinca alkaloids (14%) and visceral involvement (20%). The median duration of response was 9.1 months (95% CI: 4.2-15.0) and the median PFS was 3.0 months (95% CI: 2.4-3.8). The median OS was 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.8-7.6). The main haematological toxicity was grade 3-4 neutropenia, observed in 67% of patients (42% of cycles). Febrile neutropenia was observed in five patients (10%) and among them two were fatal. Constipation was frequently observed (but was manageable and noncumulative) and was grade 3-4 in only 8% of patients. The incidence of grade 3 nausea and vomiting was very low (4 and 6% of patients, respectively). Neither grade 3-4 sensory neuropathy nor severe venous irritation was observed. Moreover, and of importance in this particular study population, no grade 3-4 renal function impairment was observed. Vinflunine is an active agent for the treatment of platinum-pretreated bladder cancer, and these results warrant further investigation in phase III trials, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents as treatment of advanced/metastatic TCC of the bladder."
True,children diphenhydramine hydroxyzine effective hreceptor antagonists medications cause cns dysfunction evidenced increased latency measure cognitive function increased subjective somnolencenan,8792380,diphenhydramine,CNS dysfunction,"Although older, potentially sedating, ""first-generation"" antihistamines (H1-receptor antagonists) are commonly used in childhood, their central nervous system (CNS) effects have not been well-documented in young subjects. We hypothesized that diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine would affect CNS function adversely in this population. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of these medications on central and peripheral histamine H1-receptors in children. Fifteen subjects with allergic rhinitis were tested before and 2-2.5 h after administration of diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, or placebo in a double-blind, single-dose, three-way crossover study. Impairment of cognitive processing was assessed objectively by the latency of the P300 event-related potential (P300). Somnolence was assessed subjectively by a visual analog scale. Peripheral H1-blockade was assessed by suppression of the histamine-induced wheals and flares. At the central (Cz) and frontal (Fz) electrodes, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine increased the P300 latency significantly (P < 0.05) compared to baseline. Hydroxyzine increased somnolence, as recorded on the visual analog scale, significantly compared to baseline (P < 0.05), with a similar trend for diphenhydramine (P = 0.07). Both antihistamines reduced histamine-induced wheals and flares significantly compared to baseline and compared to placebo. In children, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine are effective H1-receptor antagonists, but both these medications cause CNS dysfunction, as evidenced by increased P300 latency, a measure of cognitive function, and by increased subjective somnolence."

Preclinical studies have shown that the benzodiazepines triazolam and Ro17-1812 can substitute for zaleplon in animals trained to distinguish zaleplon from saline. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can antagonise the discriminative stimulus effect of zaleplon. These findings suggest that zaleplon is recognised by animals as a benzodiazepine agent. Zaleplon is active after ip. and oral administration in a variety of motor performance tests, including locomotor activity, rotarod and the loaded grid. Zaleplon has been shown to be active in a number of different anticonvulsant models, including the pentylenetetrazole, isoniazid and electroshock models. The compound is also reported to be active against convulsions induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin and strychnine. Studies in anxiolytic models suggest that zaleplon may have weak anxiolytic activity. From preclinical studies, it appears zaleplon possesses a reduced risk of tolerance compared to triazolam, is less likely to potentiate the effects of ethanol and is unlikely to produce amnestic effects. In man, zaleplon is rapidly absorbed and undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism. The compound has a plasma half-life of approximately one hour and is metabolised primarily via the aldehyde oxidase system to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. This metabolite, along with other minor metabolites formed in vivo, do not appear to contribute to the activity of zaleplon. Metabolites of zaleplon are excreted primarily via the urine. Phase I studies suggest that single daytime doses of zaleplon up to 15 mg are well-tolerated. Short-term impairment of performance occurs when zaleplon is administered during the day at doses epsilon 20 mg. However, given the short half-life of the compound, significant impairment of daytime performance is unlikely if zaleplon is administered at bedtime or shortly after retiring for the evening. Results from Phase II/III studies suggest that zaleplon (5 - 20 mg) produces a dose-dependent reduction in sleep latency in patients suffering from primary insomnia. The clinical efficacy of zaleplon persists for at least four weeks at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. Studies in patients with a history of drug abuse suggest that the abuse potential of zaleplon (at doses above the therapeutic dose range) is similar to that seen with the benzodiazepine triazolam."
False,"study set evaluate patients metastatic colorectal carcinoma efficacy toxicity contains tegafur 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine cdhp potassium oxonate based biochemical modulation 5-fluorouracil fu targeted inhibition dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase dpdnan",10901361,potassium oxonate,colorectal carcinoma,"This study set out to evaluate, in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma, the efficacy and toxicity of S-1, which contains tegafur, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) and potassium oxonate, based on a biochemical modulation of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) targeted at inhibition of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). Sixty-three patients with measurable metastatic colorectal carcinoma were enrolled into the study. None of the patients had received prior chemotherapy except for adjuvant setting. S-1 was administered orally twice daily at a standard dose of 80 mg m(-2) day(-1) for 28 days followed by a 14-day rest. This agent is continued until disease progression, unaccepted toxicity, or patient refusal. Twenty-two (35%) of the 62 eligible patients achieved PR with a 95% confidence interval of 25-48%. Five of the 10 patients with a history of adjuvant chemotherapy achieved partial remission. The median survival time was 12 months. Major adverse reactions included myelosuppressive and gastrointestinal toxicities, though their incidence of grade 3 or 4 being 13% in neutropenia and less than 10% in the others. None of the 53 patients treated as outpatients required hospitalization due to adverse reactions: These results suggest that S-1 achieves similar responses to those of infusional 5-FU plus leucovorin and shows the potential of another biochemical modulation with easily manageable toxicity."
True,acute promyelocytic leukaemia apl treatment often includes high cumulative doses anthracyclines cause longterm cardiotoxicity nan,20230404,anthracyclines,cardiotoxicity,"Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) treatment often includes high cumulative doses of anthracyclines, which can cause long-term cardiotoxicity. Here, we report the favourable outcome in 81 paediatric APL patients treated according to the consecutive acute myeloid leukaemia-Berlin/Frankfurt/Muenster (AML-BFM) trials -93/-98/-2004 with an anthracycline-cytarabine regimen in combination with all-trans-retinoid acid (ATRA). Outcomes achieved by treatment with a reduced cumulative anthracycline dose (350 mg/m(2)) were comparable to those reported for studies with higher doses. Five-year overall survival of the total cohort was 89 +/- 4% and event-free survival (pEFS) was 73 +/- 6%. Overall survival was similar when comparing AML-BFM trial periods (trial 93: 88 +/- 8%, 98: 85 +/- 7% and 2004: 94 +/- 8%, P((logrank)) = 0.63). Seventy-five (93%) patients achieved complete remission. Most fatal events occurred during the first 6 weeks of treatment. Long-term cardiotoxicity was observed in one patient. Two patients suffered from secondary haematological malignancies. Salvage treatment was effective in 7/9 patients (78%) with relapsed APL, who now are long-term survivors after second line combination treatment with arsenic trioxide (4/7 patients) and stem cell transplantation (5/7 patients). Our results demonstrate that - combined with ATRA - a lower cumulative anthracycline dose can be used safely to maintain high cure rates and promote the reduction of long-term sequelae, such as cardiotoxicity in APL patients."

False,patients parkinson's disease pd impulse control disorder icd result dopaminergic medication use particularly dopamine agonists daanan,21604834,dopamine,Parkinson's disease/PD,"Risk-taking behavior is characterized by pursuit of reward in spite of potential negative consequences. Dopamine neurotransmission along the mesocorticolimbic pathway is a potential modulator of risk behavior. In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), impulse control disorder (ICD) can result from dopaminergic medication use, particularly dopamine agonists (DAA). Behaviors associated with ICD include hypersexuality as well as compulsive gambling, shopping, and eating, and these behaviors are potentially linked to alterations to risk processing. Using the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, we assessed the role of agonist therapy on risk-taking behavior in PD patients with (n = 22) and without (n = 19) active ICD symptoms. Patients performed the task both ""on"" and ""off"" DAA. DAA increased risk-taking in PD patients with active ICD symptoms, but it did not affect risk behavior of PD controls. DAA dose was also important in explaining risk behavior. Both groups similarly reduced their risk-taking in high compared to low risk conditions and following the occurrence of a negative consequence, suggesting that ICD patients do not necessarily differ in their abilities to process and adjust to some aspects of negative consequences. Our findings suggest dopaminergic augmentation of risk-taking behavior as a potential contributing mechanism for the emergence of ICD in PD patients."

False,molecular mechanism regulation glutathione synthesis tumor necrosis factoralpha dexamethasone human alveolar epithelial cellsnan,9988757,glutathione,tumor,"Glutathione (GSH) is an important physiological antioxidant in lung epithelial cells and lung lining fluid. We studied the regulation of GSH synthesis in response to the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549). TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml) exposure increased GSH levels, concomitant with a significant increase in gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) activity and the expression of gamma-GCS heavy subunit (gamma-GCS-HS) mRNA at 24 h. Treatment with TNF-alpha also increased chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity of a gamma-GCS-HS 5'-flanking region reporter construct, transfected into alveolar epithelial cells. Mutation of the putative proximal AP-1-binding site (-269 to -263 base pairs), abolished TNF-alpha-mediated activation of the promoter. Gel shift and supershift analysis showed that TNF-alpha increased AP-1 DNA binding which was predominantly formed by dimers of c-Jun. Dexamethasone (3 microM) produced a significant decrease in the levels of GSH, decreased gamma-GCS activity and gamma-GCS-HS mRNA expression at 24 h. The increase in GSH levels, gamma-GCS-HS mRNA, gamma-GCS-HS promoter activity, and AP-1 DNA binding produced by TNF-alpha were abrogated by co-treating the cells with dexamethasone. Thus these data demonstrate that TNF-alpha and dexamethasone modulate GSH levels and gamma-GCS-HS mRNA expression by their effects on AP-1 (c-Jun homodimer). These data have implications for the oxidant/antioxidant balance in inflammatory lung diseases."
False,iron facilitator ls081 reduces hypoxiainducible factor protein functions anticancer agent hepatocellular carcinoma nan,22181812,Iron,hepatocellular carcinoma,"Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) has a central role in cellular oxygen-sensing, and its overexpression in many types of cancer is considered important in tumor progression. Thus, targeting HIF-1α production and activity has been of great therapeutic interest. In normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is hydroxylated by oxygen-dependent prolyl-hydroxylases, which require ferrous iron for its activity. The tumor suppressor protein von Hippel Lindau binds to the hydroxylated HIF-1α, which is then ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasomes. We focused on the physiological degradation machinery of HIF-1α mediated by prolyl hydroxylases. Previously, we identified a small molecule, LS081, that is capable of stimulating iron uptake into cells. In the present study, we aimed to inhibit the expression of HIF-1α protein and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by using the iron-facilitating activity of LS081. In the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines Hep3B and HepG2, a combination of LS081 and ferric ammonium citrate (LS081/FeAC) inhibited HIF-1α protein expression but did not inhibit HIF-1α mRNA expression. A mutated HIF-1α protein, which has proline residues that were replaced with alanine and transfected into HEK293 cells, was not affected by the combination of LS081 and FeAC. Furthermore, the iron-facilitating activity of LS081 resulted in Hep3B and HepG2 growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that the iron-facilitating activity of LS081 inhibits HIF-1α expression through prolyl-hydroxylation of HIF-1α and might have a therapeutic effect in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma."

False,sirolimus sometimes discontinued side effects srl cohort subgroup stratified sirolimus duration showing progressively less fibrosis longer sirolimus durationnan,21967703,sirolimus/SRL,fibrosis,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes progressive liver fibrosis in liver transplant recipients and is the principal cause of long-term allograft failure. The antifibrotic effects of sirolimus are seen in animal models but have not been described in liver transplant recipients. We reviewed 1274 liver recipients from 2002 to 2010 and identified a cohort of HCV recipients exposed to sirolimus as primary immunosuppression (SRL Cohort) and an HCV Control Group of recipients who had never received sirolimus. Yearly protocol biopsies were done recording fibrosis stage (METAVIR score) with biopsy compliance of >80% at both year one and two. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the SRL Cohort had significantly less advanced fibrosis (stage ≥2) compared to the HCV Control Group at year one (15.3% vs. 36.2%, p < 0.0001) and year two (30.1% vs. 50.5%, p = 0.001). Because sirolimus is sometimes discontinued for side effects, the SRL Cohort was subgroup stratified for sirolimus duration, showing progressively less fibrosis with longer sirolimus duration. Multivariate analysis demonstrated sirolimus as an independent predictor of minimal fibrosis at year one, and year two. This is the first study among liver transplant recipients with recurrent HCV to describe the positive impact of sirolimus in respect of reduced fibrosis extent and rate of progression."

False,patients tumours failed progressed firstline platinum containing regimens advanced metastatic disease progressive disease platinum containing chemotherapy given adjuvant neoadjuvant intentnan,16622447,platinum,tumours,"A multicentre phase II trial to determine the efficacy of vinflunine as second-line therapy in patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder; secondary objectives were to assess duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and to evaluate the toxicity associated with this treatment. Patients had tumours that failed or progressed after first-line platinum-containing regimens for advanced or metastatic disease, or had progressive disease after platinum-containing chemotherapy given with adjuvant or neoadjuvant intent. Response and adverse events were assessed according to WHO criteria and NCI-CTC (version 2), respectively. Out of 51 patients treated with 320 mg m(-2) of vinflunine, nine patients responded to the therapy yielding an overall response rate of 18% (95% CI: 8.4-30.9%), and 67% (95%CI: 52.1-79.3%) achieved disease control (PR+SD). Of note, responses were seen in patients with relatively poor prognostic factors such as a short (<12 months) interval from prior platinum therapy (19%, including an 11% response rate in those progressing <3 months after platinum treatment), prior treatment for metastatic disease (24%), prior treatment with vinca alkaloids (14%) and visceral involvement (20%). The median duration of response was 9.1 months (95% CI: 4.2-15.0) and the median PFS was 3.0 months (95% CI: 2.4-3.8). The median OS was 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.8-7.6). The main haematological toxicity was grade 3-4 neutropenia, observed in 67% of patients (42% of cycles). Febrile neutropenia was observed in five patients (10%) and among them two were fatal. Constipation was frequently observed (but was manageable and noncumulative) and was grade 3-4 in only 8% of patients. The incidence of grade 3 nausea and vomiting was very low (4 and 6% of patients, respectively). Neither grade 3-4 sensory neuropathy nor severe venous irritation was observed. Moreover, and of importance in this particular study population, no grade 3-4 renal function impairment was observed. Vinflunine is an active agent for the treatment of platinum-pretreated bladder cancer, and these results warrant further investigation in phase III trials, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents as treatment of advanced/metastatic TCC of the bladder."
False,therapeutic adjuncts treating ethanol withdrawal including nmda calcium glucocorticoid antagonists may eventually prove useful preventing brain damage alcoholism nan,8123218,ethanol,alcoholism,"Alcoholism is often associated with brain damage and cognitive deficits. Because drinking patterns can include periods of alcohol consumption followed by abstinence, binge drinking may enhance the possibility of brain damage. Chronic administration of ethanol leads to upregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and calcium receptors and increased release of glucocorticoids. NMDA-mediated mechanisms and glucocorticoid actions on the hippocampus are associated with brain damage. Thus, ethanol withdrawal may make the brain more vulnerable to damage from these mechanisms, especially with binge drinking. Therapeutic adjuncts for treating ethanol withdrawal, including NMDA, calcium, and glucocorticoid antagonists, may eventually prove useful in preventing further brain damage in alcoholism."
True,established cancer drugs anthracyclines also form ros free radicals responsible cardiotoxicity anthracyclines nan,15183112,anthracyclines,cardiotoxicity,"The antimalarial artemisinins also reveal profound cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. Artemisinins harbor an endoperoxide bridge whose cleavage results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or artemisinin carbon-centered free radicals. Established cancer drugs such as anthracyclines also form ROS and free radicals that are responsible for the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines. In contrast, artemisinins do not reveal cardiotoxicity. In the present investigation, we compared the cytotoxic activities of different artemisinins (artemisinin, artesunate, arteether, artemether, artemisitene, dihydroartemisinylester stereoisomers) in 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA, with those of anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, 4'-epirubicin, idarubicin, deoxydoxorubicin, trifluoroacetyl-doxorubicin-14-valerate). The inhibition concentration 50% (IC(50)) values of artemisinins and anthracyclines were correlated with the mRNA expression of 170 genes involved in oxygen stress response and metabolism as recently determined by microarray analysis and deposited in the NCI database (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov). The genes whose expression was significantly linked to cellular drug response in Kendall's tau tests were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and cluster image mapping. Mathematical correction for false-positive correlations was done by a false discovery rate algorithm. One cluster contained predominantly genes with a relationship to artemisinins and another one genes with a relationship to anthracyclines. In a third cluster, genes correlating to both drug classes were assembled. This indicates that different sets of genes involved in oxidative stress response and metabolism may contribute to the cytotoxic and differing toxic side effects of these drug classes."
True,moreover alcohol abuse produce cardiac arrhythmias hypertension cardiomyopathy stroke even sudden deathnan,9751945,alcohol,stroke,"The ingestion of one or two alcoholic drinks can affect heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, myocardial contractility, and regional blood flow. These actions generally are not clinically important. In the presence of cardiovascular disease, however, even such small quantities of alcohol might result in transient unfavorable hemodynamic changes. Moreover, alcohol abuse can produce cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, stroke, and even sudden death. In contrast, moderate alcohol use produces changes that have an overall favorable effect on atherosclerotic-related vascular diseases. Because cardiovascular disease due to atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in Western society, this desirable effect of alcohol use outweighs its detrimental actions, resulting in favorable findings in population studies. Nevertheless, the body of evidence argues against encouraging alcohol use for its cardiovascular effects."
True,gaba involvement naloxone induced reversal respiratory paralysis produced thiopental nan,2893236,thiopental,respiratory paralysis,"No agent is yet available to reverse respiratory paralysis produced by CNS depressants, such as general anesthetics. In this study naloxone reversed respiratory paralysis induced by thiopental in rats. 25 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate, increased GABA, decreased glutamate, and had no effect on aspartate or glycine levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem. Pretreatment of rats with thiosemicarbazide for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of thiopental. 50 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced respiratory arrest with further increase in GABA and decrease in glutamate again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the amino acids studied in four regions of rat brain. Naloxone (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) reversed respiratory paralysis, glutamate and GABA levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum. These data suggest naloxone reverses respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental and involves GABA in its action."

Acetaminophen-poisoned cats develop methemoglobinemia and sometimes hepatic failure. To determine the benefit of using methylene blue, a treatment for methemoglobinemia, along with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the recommended treatment for acetaminophen-poisoned cats, groups of 3 male and 3 female cats each were given methylene blue NAC, or both after administration of acetaminophen (120 mg/kg of body weight, PO). Male cats seemed more susceptible than female cats to acetaminophen toxicosis, because 3 males died of hepatic failure (2 cats given acetaminophen/methylene blue and 1 given acetaminophen/NAC/methylene blue). Although NAC alone seemed to elicit the best overall response, methylene blue, alone or in combination with NAC, may be useful in female cats."

Ramosetron (0.3 to 100 microg/kg, p.o.) has been found to significantly suppress abnormal defecation induced by conditioned-fear stress (CFS), restraint stress, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and 5-HT in rats and mice, and these effects were more potent than those of alosetron, cilansetron or loperamide. On the other hand, ramosetron (3,000 microg/kg, p. o., once daily for 7 days) did not inhibit normal defecation in dogs while tiquizium significantly inhibited it. Ramosetron (3 to 100 microg/kg, p. o.) also significantly prevented CFS-induced acceleration of colonic transit and CRF-induced abnormal water transport in rats, respectively. Moreover, ramosetron (0.3 to 3 microg/kg, p. o.) significantly suppressed restraint stress-induced decrease in colonic pain threshold, an effect not observed with loperamide. These results indicate that ramosetron produce beneficial clinical effects on IBS symptoms."
False,pyrazinamide susceptibility testing mycobacterium tuberculosis systematic review metaanalysesnan,21768515,Pyrazinamide,tuberculosis,"Standard culture-based testing of the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to pyrazinamide is difficult to perform. This systematic review with meta-analyses evaluated the roles of molecular assays targeting pncA and of pyrazinamidase assays. PubMed and Embase were searched for relevant publications in English. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated in bivariate random-effects models. Of 128 articles identified, 73 sets of data involving culture isolates were initially included in meta-analyses. Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were 87% and 93% for PCR-DNA sequencing (n = 29), 75% and 95% for PCR-single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) (n = 5), 96% and 97% for a mixture of other molecular assays (n = 6), and 89% and 97% for pyrazinamidase assays using the Wayne method (n = 33). The median prevalence (range) of pyrazinamide resistance was 51% (31% to 89%) in multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates and 5% (0% to 9%) in non-multidrug-resistant isolates. Excluding studies with possibly considerable false resistance in the reference assay gave the following estimates of sensitivity and specificity, respectively: 92% and 93% for PCR-DNA sequencing (n = 20), 98% and 96% for other molecular assays (n = 5), and 91% and 97% for the Wayne assay (n = 27). The Wayne assay had significant funnel plot asymmetry, so the test performance might have been overestimated. Considering the prevalence of pyrazinamide resistance in different clinical settings, PCR-DNA sequencing, and possibly other molecular assays targeting pncA, can detect pyrazinamide resistance in multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates, with predictive values largely exceeding 90%, and rule out pyrazinamide resistance in non-multidrug-resistant isolates, with predictive values exceeding 99%. Molecular assays are probably the way forward for detecting pyrazinamide resistance."

Glutamatergic synapses are found in central regions related to pain transmission, plasticity and modulation. Glutamate NMDA receptors in forebrain structures are well known to contribute to the formation and storage of information. Here we propose the hypothesis that forebrain NMDA receptors play an important role in persistent inflammatory pain by re-enforcing glutamate sensory transmission in the brain. Mice with enhanced function of forebrain NMDA receptors demonstrate selective enhancement of persistent pain and allodynia. Drugs targeting forebrain NMDA NR2B receptors may serve as a new class of medicine to control persistent pain in humans."

True,awake sheep example almost levobupivacaine required cause death nan,11945112,levobupivacaine,death,"Bupivacaine is currently the most widely used long-acting local anaesthetic. Its uses include surgery and obstetrics; however, it has been associated with potentially fatal cardiotoxicity, particularly when given intravascularly by accident. Levobupivacaine, a single enantiomer of bupivacaine, has recently been introduced as a new long-acting local anaesthetic with a potentially reduced toxicity compared with bupivacaine. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have compared levobupivacaine with bupivacaine and in most but not all studies there is evidence that levobupivacaine is less toxic. Advantages for levobupivacaine are seen on cardiac sodium and potassium channels, on isolated animal hearts and in whole animals, anaesthetised or awake. In particular the intravascular dose of levobupivacaine required to cause lethality in animals is consistently higher compared with bupivacaine. In awake sheep, for example, almost 78% more levobupivacaine was required to cause death. In contrast, in anaesthetised dogs no differences were seen in the incidence of spontaneous or electrical stimulation- induced ventricular tachycardia and fibrillations among animals exposed to levobupivacaine or bupivacaine. The reversibility of levobupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity has also been assessed. Some data point to an advantage of levobupivacaine over bupivacaine but this potential advantage was not confirmed in a recent study in anaesthetised dogs. Three clinical studies have been conducted using surrogate markers of both cardiac and CNS toxicity. In these studies levobupivacaine or bupivacaine were given by intravascular injection to healthy volunteers. Levobupivacaine was found to cause smaller changes in indices of cardiac contractility and the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and also to have less depressant effect on the electroencephalogram. Assuming that levobupivacaine has the same local anaesthetic potency as bupivacaine, then, all things being equal, it is difficult to argue that levobupivacaine should not displace bupivacaine as the long-acting local anaesthetic of choice. It would appear, however, that levobupivacaine has not yet significantly displaced bupivacaine from the markets in which it is sold. This may be due to a lack of perceived safety benefit and/or consideration of the additional costs that are associated with switching to levobupivacaine, which is approximately 57% more expensive than bupivacaine. If the price of levobupivacaine were closer to bupivacaine then the argument to switch to levobupivacaine would undoubtedly be much stronger. With the continued clinical use of levobupivacaine the database available to make comparisons will increase and this may allow cost-benefit arguments to be made more forcefully for levobupivacaine in the future."

Simvastatin/placebo was given at 3-12 h from symptom onset to 60 patients with cortical strokes. Efficacy on the evolution of several inflammation markers [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, C-reactive protein, sApo/Fas, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, E-selectin, L-selectin and nitrites+nitrates] and neurological outcome was evaluated at baseline, day 1, 3, 5, 7 and 90. No differences were found amongst the biomarkers studied regarding treatment allocation. Although simvastatin patients improved significantly by the third day (46.4% vs. 17.9%, P = 0.022), a non-significant increase in mortality and greater proportion of infections (odds ratio 2.4, confidence interval 1.06-5.4) in the simvastatin group were the main safety concerns. Therefore, a larger clinical trial is needed to confirm the net benefit of this therapeutic approach."

True,although increased report effects diet containing tfas risk factor metabolic syndrome diabetes mellitus coronary heart disease observed recent years influence intestinal inflammation remains unknownnan,24251700,TFAs,coronary heart disease,"Fatty acids in our daily diet are broadly classified into cis and trans fatty acids (TFAs). TFAs are formed during the manufacturing process of hydrogenated vegetable oils such as margarine. Modern diets such as deep-fried products, frozen foods, and packaged snacks commonly include large quantities of margarine containing TFAs. Although an increased report in the effects of the diet containing TFAs on a risk factor of metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease has been observed in the recent years, influence on intestinal inflammation remains unknown. This review describes pro-inflammatory effects of TFAs in our diary diet on various systemic disorders and also discusses a possible role of TFAs on gut inflammation. "
True,randomised clinical trials observational studies shown increased risk myocardial infarction stroke hypertension heart failure treatment cyclooxygenase inhibitors nan,16586083,cyclooxygenase inhibitors,stroke,"Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with concomitant risk factors. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal, vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time. A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance-specific differences, which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin-independent effects. Diagnostic markers such as N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or high-sensitive C-reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity."
True,cardiomyocyte calcium ca loading recognized major factor acute ischaemiareperfusion pathology promoting cell death contractile dysfunction arrhythmogenic activitynan,21722161,calcium,death,"1. Important sex differences exist in ischaemic heart disease. Oestrogen has been conventionally regarded as providing a cardioprotective benefit and testosterone frequently perceived to exert a deleterious effect. However, there is accumulating evidence that argues against this simple dichotomy, suggesting that the influence of oestrogen and testosterone conferring benefit or detriment may be context specific. 2. Cardiomyocyte calcium (Ca(2+)) loading is recognized to be a major factor in acute ischaemia-reperfusion pathology, promoting cell death, contractile dysfunction and arrhythmogenic activity. Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is a mediator of many of the cardiomyocyte Ca(2+)-related pathologies in ischaemia-reperfusion. Cardiomyocyte Ca(2+)-handling processes have been shown to be modulated by the actions of oestrogen and testosterone. A role for these sex steroids in influencing CaMKII activation is argued. 3. Although many experimental studies of oestrogen manipulation can identify a cardioprotective role for this sex steroid, there are also numerous reports that fail to demonstrate sex differences in postischaemic recovery. Experimental studies report that testosterone can be protective in ischaemia-reperfusion in males and females in some settings. 4. Further studies of sex steroid influence in the ischaemic heart will allow the development of therapeutic interventions that are specifically targeted for male and female hearts."

False,compared doseresponse curves relating changes coronary blood flow epicardial diameter graded infusions acetylcholine african american white subjects hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy lvh normal coronary arteriesnan,12913059,acetylcholine,hypertensive,"Excess coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality among African Americans remains an important yet unexplained public health problem. We hypothesized that adverse outcome is in part due to intrinsic or acquired abnormalities in coronary endothelial function and vasoreactivity. We compared dose-response curves relating changes in coronary blood flow and epicardial diameter to graded infusions of acetylcholine in 50 African American and 65 white subjects with hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and normal coronary arteries. These groups were similar for age, body mass index, mean arterial pressure, and indexed left ventricular mass. The same protocol was conducted in 24 normotensive African American and 56 similar white subjects. We found significant depression in the coronary blood flow dose-response curve relation among African Americans when compared with white subjects with similar LVH (P<0.03). Racial differences were observed at all doses of acetylcholine but were less precisely estimated at the highest dose. The same testing among normotensive subjects revealed similar dose-response curves with no significant effect of race. Qualitatively similar results were found with respect to coronary diameter. Adenosine responses, a measure of endothelium-independent function, were similar after partitioning by LVH. Our study demonstrates that there are racial differences in sensitivity of coronary arteries to acetylcholine-stimulated relaxation among those with LVH. These results provide a mechanism whereby racial differences in coronary vasoreactivity might contribute to adverse coronary heart disease outcome among African Americans, a group in whom LVH is prevalent."

False,mutation squamous cell carcinomas psoriasis patients treated psoralen uva puvanan,9242514,psoralen,squamous cell carcinomas,"Individuals suffering from psoriasis are treated with a combination of psoralen and UVA radiation, commonly referred to as ""PUVA"" therapy. Epidemiologic studies have shown that PUVA therapy is a risk factor for skin cancer in psoriasis patients. Although PUVA treatment induces skin cancer in laboratory animals, it is unknown whether the increased incidence of skin cancer reported in PUVA-treated psoriasis patients is due to the carcinogenic effects of PUVA or due to other factors such as UVB. Because UV and PUVA induce different types of DNA damage resulting in unique types of p53 mutation, we investigated whether skin cancers from PUVA-treated psoriasis patients have PUVA-type or UV-type p53 mutations. Analysis of 17 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) from Austrian PUVA-treated patients revealed a total of 25 p53 mutations in 11 SCCs. A majority of p53 mutations occurred at 5'TpG sites. Although previous studies have shown that 5'TpA sites are the primary targets for PUVA mutagenesis, substitutions at 5'TpG sites are also quite common. Interestingly, a sizable portion of p53 mutations detected were C-->T or CC-->TT transitions, characteristic of UV-induced mutations. Because some psoriasis patients had substantial exposure to UVB before PUVA therapy and because the light sources used in PUVA therapy contained small but significant wavelengths in the UVB region, it is possible that the C-->T and CC-->TT transitions detected in SCCs from PUVA-treated patients were induced by UVB. Nonetheless, our results indicate that both PUVA and UVB may play a role in the development of skin cancer in Austrian psoriasis patients who undergo PUVA therapy."

Although most of the hepatomas were well-differentiated tumors and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes, the tumor cells did not respond to ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate with proliferation of peroxisomes. At the 16th week of carcinogen feeding, hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages. A majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes. Within the nodules, foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared. These cells proliferated further, replacing the most part of the nodules, and with this process hepatomas appeared to have been formed. No abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate unlike in the case of rats."
False,choline acetyltransferase chat activator enhances cholinergic transmission via augmentation enzymatic production acetylcholine ach important factor treatment alzheimers disease ad choline acetyltransferase activator protein choline important treating alzheimers disease,16428827,choline,AD/Alzheimer's disease,"The choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activator, which enhances cholinergic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of acetylcholine (ACh), is an important factor in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect (46%) on ChAT in vitro. Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana, the active component was ultimately identified as daidzein (4',7-dihydroxy-isoflavone). In order to investigate the effects of daidzein from Pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine-induced impairments of learning and memory, we conducted a series of in vivo tests. Administration of daidzein (4.5 mg/kg body weight) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia, according to the results of a Y-maze test. Injections of scopolamine into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y-maze tests (a 37% decreases in alternation behavior). By way of contrast, mice treated with daidzein prior to the scopolamine injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment (an approximately 12%-21% decrease in alternation behavior). These results indicate that daidzein might play a role in acetylcholine biosynthesis as a ChAT activator, and that it also ameliorates scopolamine-induced amnesia."

Serial liver biopsies showed the development and resolution of intense sinusoidal engorgement. Although this disease was clinically reversible, some subintimal fibrosis about the terminal hepatic veins persisted. This case presented a unique opportunity to observe the histologic features of clinically reversible hepatic veno-occlusive disease over time, and may be the first case of veno-occlusive related solely to 6-thioguanine."

The traditional view is that cocaine causes a hypermetabolic state with increased heat production. However, because cocaine-induced hyperthermia occurs primarily in hot weather, it is hypothesized that cocaine also impairs thermoregulatory adjustments that mediate heat dissipation."
False,experiments suggest gossypol gossypolone dithianes dithiolanes used prodrugs target tumor cells surrounded high concentrations nitric oxidenan,12670651,gossypol,tumor,"New dithiane or dithiolane derivatives of gossypol and gossypolone were synthesized with dithiolethane or dithiolpropane in the presence of BF(3)/Et(2)O. These thioderivatives exhibited low toxicity on KB cells (human epidermoid carcinoma cells of the mouth). They react easily with electrophiles in aprotic solvents to regenerate gossypolone or to form dehydrogossypoldithianes and dehydrogossypoldithiolanes, which display higher toxicity on KB cells. In addition, the low toxicity of gossypol thioderivatives was reversed by nitric oxide donors in physiological media. These experiments suggest that gossypol and gossypolone dithianes and dithiolanes can be used as prodrugs that target tumor cells surrounded by high concentrations of nitric oxide."

Clinical electrocardiographic evolution was similar to that observed in Prinzmetal's angina, and chest pain promptly resolved with nifedipine. These data suggest that coronary spasm may be the cause of cardiotoxicity due to 5-FU, and that calcium antagonists may probably be used in the prevention or treatment of 5-FU cardiotoxicity."
False,pomalidomide therapy effective alleviating anemia myelofibrosis examined relationship plasma cytokinechemokine levels response treatment pomalidomide nan,21442636,Pomalidomide,myelofibrosis,"Cytokine-phenotype associations have recently been described in primary myelofibrosis and increased levels of IL-8, sIL-2R, IL-12, and IL-15 were found to be independently predictive of inferior survival. Pomalidomide therapy is effective for alleviating anemia in myelofibrosis; we examined the relationship between plasma cytokine/chemokine levels and response to treatment with pomalidomide. The study population included 32 Mayo Clinic patients (median age 66 years) who participated in two consecutive clinical trials of pomalidomide therapy for myelofibrosis-associated anemia. Ten (31%) patients achieved anemia response per International Working Group criteria. Anemia response was seen only in the presence of JAK2V617F (P = 0.04) and, in addition, predicted by lower circulating levels of MCP-1 (P = 0.003), IL-2R (P = 0.008), IL-15 (0.01), and IL-8 (P = 0.02). Marked splenomegaly and increased serum LDH level were associated with poor response (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively) and with each other (P = 0.02), but not with JAK2V617F. The aforementioned cytokines were not significantly associated with JAK2V617F but increased levels of sIL-2R (P = 0.01), IL-15 (P = 0.06), and MCP-1 (P = 0.07) clustered with marked splenomegaly. Current data suggest that, in the context of pomalidomide treatment, response is more likely in the presence of JAK2V617F and further predicted by the absence of marked splenomegaly or increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines."
False,cytotoxicity due exposure ndma partially inhibited antioxidants nacetylcysteine ascorbic acid butylated hydroxyanisole n-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone potentiated upon glutathione depletionnan,9498284,butylated hydroxyanisole,cytotoxicity,"GM0637, a human fibroblast cell line, was transfected with pCMV2E1, an expression vector containing the full length cDNA for rat cytochrome P450 2E1 (P450 2E1), and with pCMVneo, which contained vector alone, and the selected clones were designated GM2E1 and GMneo, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that GM2E1, but not GMneo, expressed a protein that reacted with anti-human P450 2E1 antibody. The 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase,p-nitrophenol hydroxylase, and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) demethylase activities of the P450 in these cells were measured in monolayer cell cultures without preparing microsomes. Exposure of the GM2E1 cells to NDMA for 4 days caused severe decreases in cell viability, as determined by crystal violet uptake, and showed a sigmoidal dose-response curve with a median lethal dose of 17 microM. In contrast, the viability of GMneo cells was not altered by NDMA even at concentrations up to 10 mM. Time- and concentration-dependent methylation of DNA, RNA and protein by [14C]NDMA was only observed in cells expressing P450 2E1. Inhibitors of P450 2E1 activity such as ethanol, 4-methylpyrazole, and isoniazid caused a 90% decrease in the methylation of cellular macromolecules and also completely protected the cells against NDMA-mediated toxicity. The cytotoxicity due to exposure to NDMA was partially inhibited by antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole and N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone but was not potentiated upon glutathione depletion. These results document the ability of rat P450 2E1 to metabolize NDMA to toxic reactive intermediates and demonstrate that this cell line provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of metabolism-mediated toxicity and carcinogenesis."

Prolongation of QT interval, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents, but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem, an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for hypertension. The patient was in near syncope and had QT-interval prolongation. After discontinuing cisapride, the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur. We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, including diltiazem."
False,comparative study coumadin aspirin primary cardioembolic stroke thromboembolic preventions chronic rheumatic mitral stenosis atrial fibrillationnan,7798824,aspirin,thromboembolic,"The comparative study of the efficacy of coumadin and aspirin in primary cardioembolic stroke prevention of chronic rheumatic heart disease (mitral stenosis) with atrial fibrillation was conducted at Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the trial. Allocation of patients into coumadin or aspirin groups depended upon the patients' choice. Nineteen patients were given coumadin at the adjusted dosage to maintain the therapeutic range of International Normalised Ratio between 1.5-3. Sixty patients were given aspirin at the fixed dosage of 75 mg per day. Six patients were lost to follow-up over the 3 yr period; four in the aspirin group and 2 in the coumadin group. There were three patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke in the aspirin group but none in the coumadin group after three years of follow-up. Six patients had mitral valve replacement during the study (i.e. three patients in each group). There were complications in 12 patients, 10 in the aspirin (16.6 per cent) and 2 in the coumadin (10.5 per cent) group. The complications in coumadin group were minor bleeding over the thigh in one patient and generalised ecchymosis over the whole body in one other. In the aspirin group, the complication was gastrointestional symptoms, mainly epigastric pain, but no frank bleeding was observed. Primary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in chronic rheumatic heart disease was found to be more effective with coumadin than aspirin. Our study does not support the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiac embolism in chronic rheumatic heart disease."
False,aimed identify contribution hps engraftment failure cbt following preparative regimens containing fludarabine phosphate  patients median age years range years haematological diseasesnan,19709082,fludarabine phosphate,HPS,"Umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT) is widely accepted, but one critical issue for adult patients is a low engraftment rate, of which one cause is haemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). We aimed to identify the contribution of HPS to engraftment failure after CBT, following preparative regimens containing fludarabine phosphate, in 119 patients (median age, 55 years; range; 17-69 years) with haematological diseases. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis comprised continuous infusion of a calcineurin inhibitor with or without mycophenolate mofetil. Of the 119 patients, 20 developed HPS within a median of 15 d (cumulative incidence; 16.8%) and 17 of them did so before engraftment. Donor-dominant chimaerism was confirmed in 16 of 18 evaluable patients with HPS. Despite aggressive interventions including corticosteroid, ciclosporin, high-dose immunoglobulin and/or etoposide, engraftment failed in 14 of 18 patients. Of these 14 patients, four received second rescue transplantation and all resulted in successful engraftment. Overall survival rates significantly differed between patients with and without HPS (15.0% vs. 35.4%; P < 0.01). Univariate and multivariate analysis identified having fewer infused CD34(+) cells as a significant risk factor for the development of HPS (P = 0.01 and 0.006, respectively). We concluded that engraftment failure closely correlated with HPS in our cohort, which negatively impacted overall survival after CBT."

True,repeated topical exposure chromium(vi) may cause allergic contact dermatitis formation chrome ulcers nan,10382555,chromium(VI),ulcers,"Repeated topical exposure to chromium(VI) may cause an allergic contact dermatitis or the formation of chrome ulcers. Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III)."

True,irregular menstrual bleeding may arise due exogenous sex steroids lesions genital tract associated anovulationnan,22972055,steroids,menstrual bleeding,"Irregular menstrual bleeding may arise due to exogenous sex steroids, lesions of the genital tract or be associated with anovulation. Irregular bleeding due to oligo/anovulation (previously called dysfunctional uterine bleeding or DUB) is more common at the extremes of reproductive life, and in women with ovulatory disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In anovulatory cycles there may be prolonged oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium without progesterone withdrawal and so cycles are irregular and bleeding may be heavy. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle, in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination, are widely used in the management of irregular menstrual bleeding, but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used vary widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach."

Our results showed that the presence of either a double bond at C-1/C-2, or a bromine atom or formyl moiety at C-2 as well as the presence of an isoxazol ring in argentatin A enhanced its potency in all cell lines tested. In addition, an X-ray study of (16S,17R,20S,24R)-3-oxime-20,24-epoxy-16,25-dihydroxy-cycloartan-3-one led to the determination of the correct stereochemistry of argentatin A."

False,results show key role gaba ar subunit dephosphorylation downregulation gabaergic synaptic transmission brain ischemia contributing neuronal deathnan gabaar subunit gaba,24513087,GABA,brain ischemia,"Cerebral ischemia is characterized by an early disruption of GABAergic neurotransmission contributing to an imbalance of the excitatory/inhibitory equilibrium and neuronal death, but the molecular mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Here we report a downregulation of GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) expression, affecting both mRNA and protein levels of GABA(A)R subunits, in hippocampal neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro model of ischemia. Similar alterations in the abundance of GABA(A)R subunits were observed in in vivo brain ischemia. OGD reduced the interaction of surface GABA(A)R with the scaffold protein gephyrin, followed by clathrin-dependent receptor internalization. Internalization of GABA(A)R was dependent on glutamate receptor activation and mediated by dephosphorylation of the β3 subunit at serine 408/409. Expression of phospho-mimetic mutant GABA(A)R β3 subunits prevented receptor internalization and protected hippocampal neurons from ischemic cell death. The results show a key role for β3 GABA(A)R subunit dephosphorylation in the downregulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission in brain ischemia, contributing to neuronal death. GABA(A)R phosphorylation might be a therapeutic target to preserve synaptic inhibition in brain ischemia."

Acetaminophen-poisoned cats develop methemoglobinemia and sometimes hepatic failure. To determine the benefit of using methylene blue, a treatment for methemoglobinemia, along with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the recommended treatment for acetaminophen-poisoned cats, groups of 3 male and 3 female cats each were given methylene blue NAC, or both after administration of acetaminophen (120 mg/kg of body weight, PO). Male cats seemed more susceptible than female cats to acetaminophen toxicosis, because 3 males died of hepatic failure (2 cats given acetaminophen/methylene blue and 1 given acetaminophen/NAC/methylene blue). Although NAC alone seemed to elicit the best overall response, methylene blue, alone or in combination with NAC, may be useful in female cats."

We performed post-hoc analyses in the four RECORD studies (REgulation of Coagulation in major Orthopaedic surgery reducing the Risk of Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). Separate analyses were performed for patients undergoing elective total hip or knee replacement. Outcome measures were symptomatic VTE and ""total VTE"" (defined as the composite of symptomatic VTE, asymptomatic DVT assessed by per protocol venography and all cause mortality). Glucose levels were measured pre-op and 6 hours post-op, categorised into quartiles, based on the distribution in the respective cohorts. The influence of glucose, adjusted for body mass index, age, gender and diabetes mellitus on VTE was assessed by logistic regression analyses. A total of 12,383 patients were eligible for assessment of symptomatic VTE, and 8,512 patients were eligible for assessment of total VTE. Increased glucose levels after total hip replacement were associated with total VTE; adjusted odds ratio (OR) highest versus lowest quartile 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 3.0). Furthermore, increase in glucose levels during total hip replacement was associated with total VTE (OR highest versus lowest quartile 1.8 (95%CI 1.2 to 2.8). This was not observed in patients undergoing total knee replacement, probably due to differences in the applied surgical procedures."
True,effect calcium chloride injected cerebral ventricles grouphoused unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization rage hissing snarling fighting attack paws claws defense paws claws biting mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsions produced carbachol eserine injected similarly investigatednan,6892185,carbachol,mydriasis,"The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."

False,mutation squamous cell carcinomas psoriasis patients treated psoralen uva puvanan,9242514,psoralen,psoriasis,"Individuals suffering from psoriasis are treated with a combination of psoralen and UVA radiation, commonly referred to as ""PUVA"" therapy. Epidemiologic studies have shown that PUVA therapy is a risk factor for skin cancer in psoriasis patients. Although PUVA treatment induces skin cancer in laboratory animals, it is unknown whether the increased incidence of skin cancer reported in PUVA-treated psoriasis patients is due to the carcinogenic effects of PUVA or due to other factors such as UVB. Because UV and PUVA induce different types of DNA damage resulting in unique types of p53 mutation, we investigated whether skin cancers from PUVA-treated psoriasis patients have PUVA-type or UV-type p53 mutations. Analysis of 17 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) from Austrian PUVA-treated patients revealed a total of 25 p53 mutations in 11 SCCs. A majority of p53 mutations occurred at 5'TpG sites. Although previous studies have shown that 5'TpA sites are the primary targets for PUVA mutagenesis, substitutions at 5'TpG sites are also quite common. Interestingly, a sizable portion of p53 mutations detected were C-->T or CC-->TT transitions, characteristic of UV-induced mutations. Because some psoriasis patients had substantial exposure to UVB before PUVA therapy and because the light sources used in PUVA therapy contained small but significant wavelengths in the UVB region, it is possible that the C-->T and CC-->TT transitions detected in SCCs from PUVA-treated patients were induced by UVB. Nonetheless, our results indicate that both PUVA and UVB may play a role in the development of skin cancer in Austrian psoriasis patients who undergo PUVA therapy."

False,compared oral opioids advantages transdermal fentanyl include lower incidence impact adverse effects constipation nausea vomiting daytime drowsiness higher degree patient satisfaction improved quality life improved convenience compliance resulting administration every hours decreased use rescue medicationnan,14583070,fentanyl,constipation,"Transdermal fentanyl is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of chronic pain caused by malignancy and non-malignant conditions when administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Compared with oral opioids, the advantages of transdermal fentanyl include a lower incidence and impact of adverse effects (constipation, nausea and vomiting, and daytime drowsiness), a higher degree of patient satisfaction, improved quality of life, improved convenience and compliance resulting from administration every 72 hours, and decreased use of rescue medication. Transdermal fentanyl is a useful analgesic for cancer patients who are unable to swallow or have gastrointestinal problems. Transdermal fentanyl forms a depot within the upper skin layers before entering the microcirculation. Therapeutic blood levels are attained 12-16 hours after patch application and decrease slowly with a half-life of 16-22 hours following removal. Patients with chronic pain should be titrated to adequate relief with short-acting oral or parenteral opioids prior to the initiation of transdermal fentanyl in order to prevent exacerbations of pain or opioid-related adverse effects. Transdermal fentanyl can then be initiated based on the 24-hour opioid requirement once adequate analgesia has been achieved. The prolonged elimination of transdermal fentanyl can become problematic if patients develop opioid-related adverse effects, especially hypoventilation. Adverse effects do not improve immediately after patch removal and may take many hours to resolve. Patients who experience opioid-related toxicity associated with respiratory depression should be treated immediately with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone and closely monitored for at least 24 hours. Because of the short half-life of naloxone, sequential doses or a continuous infusion of the opioid antagonist may be necessary. Transdermal fentanyl should be administered cautiously to patients with pre-existing conditions such as emphysema that may predispose them to the development of hypoventilation. Transdermal fentanyl is indicated only for patients who require continuous opioid administration for the treatment of chronic pain that cannot be managed with other medications. It is contraindicated in the management of acute and postoperative pain, as pain may decrease more rapidly in these circumstances than fentanyl blood levels can be adjusted, leading to the development of life-threatening hypoventilation. Cognitive and physical impairments such as confusion and abnormal co-ordination can occur with transdermal fentanyl. Therefore, patients should be instructed to refrain from driving or operating machinery immediately following the initiation of transdermal fentanyl, or after any dosage increase. Patients may resume such activities once the absence of these potential adverse effects is documented."

However, there are two case reports that show tic-like symptoms, including motor and phonic variants, occurring during treatment with quetiapine or clozapine. We present a 15-year-old girl schizophrenic who developed frequent involuntary eye-blinking movements after 5 months of amisulpride treatment (1000 mg per day). The tic-like symptoms resolved completely after we reduced the dose of amisulpride down to 800 mg per day. However, her psychosis recurred after the dose reduction. We then placed her on an additional 100 mg per day of quetiapine. She has been in complete remission under the combined medications for more than one year and maintains a fair role function. No more tic-like symptoms or other side effects have been reported. Together with previously reported cases, our patient suggests that tic-like symptoms might occur in certain vulnerable individuals during treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine, clozapine, or amisulpride."
True,report describes case cognitive deterioration resulting prolonged use dm nan,7803371,DM,cognitive deterioration,"Dextromethorphan (DM), the dextrorotatory isomer of 3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan, is the main ingredient in a number of widely available, over-the-counter antitussives. Initial studies (Bornstein 1968) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability. Subsequently, however, several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature. The drug is known to cause a variety of acute toxic effects, ranging from nausea, restlessness, insomnia, ataxia, slurred speech and nystagmus to mood changes, perceptual alterations, inattention, disorientation and aggressive behavior (Rammer et al 1988; Katona and Watson 1986; Isbell and Fraser 1953; Devlin et al 1985; McCarthy 1971; Dodds and Revai 1967; Degkwitz 1964; Hildebrand et al 1989). There have also been two reported fatalities from DM overdoses (Fleming 1986). However, there are no reports describing the effects of chronic abuse.

True,vivo probebased confocal laser endomicroscopy amiodarone related pneumonia nan,23018901,amiodarone,pneumonia,"Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) allows microscopic imaging of the alveoli during bronchoscopy. The objective of the study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of pCLE for amiodarone-related pneumonia (AMR-IP). Alveolar pCLE was performed in 36 nonsmoking patients, including 33 consecutive patients with acute or subacute interstitial lung disease (ILD), of which 17 were undergoing treatment with amiodarone, and three were amiodarone-treated patients without ILD. Nine out of 17 patients were diagnosed with high-probability AMR-IP (HP-AMR-IP) by four experts, and three separate observers. Bronchoalveolar lavage findings did not differ between HP-AMR-IP and low-probability AMR-IP (LP-AMR-IP) patients. In HP-AMR-IP patients, pCLE showed large (>20 μm) and strongly fluorescent cells in 32 out of 38 alveolar areas. In contrast, these cells were observed in only two out of 39 areas from LP-AMR-IP patients, in one out of 59 areas from ILD patients not receiving amiodarone and in none of the 10 areas from amiodarone-treated patients without ILD (p<0.001; HP-AMR-IP versus other groups). The presence of at least one alveolar area with large and fluorescent cells had a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value for the diagnosis of AMR-IP of 100%, 88%, 100% and 90%, respectively. In conclusion, pCLE appears to be a valuable tool for the in vivo diagnosis of AMR-IP in subacute ILD patients. "

In a pivotal phase III trial in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma that had progressed despite first-line therapy, axitinib 5 mg twice daily significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (primary endpoint) compared with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. A significant between-group difference favouring axitinib over sorafenib in terms of progression-free survival was maintained in the subgroups of patients who had previously received cytokine or sunitinib therapy. However, median overall survival was not significantly different between the treatment groups. Significantly more axitinib than sorafenib recipients achieved an objective response, and axitinib therapy significantly prolonged time to deterioration (a composite endpoint of death, disease progression and symptom worsening) relative to sorafenib therapy. While its tolerability profile was generally consistent with that of other VEGF receptor inhibitors, axitinib was associated with a numerically lower incidence of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia, cutaneous toxicity and anaemia than sorafenib in the phase III trial."
False,conclusion results suggest angiotensin iconverting enzyme inhibitor perindopril superior calcium channel blocker amlodipine reducing vascular endothelial dysfunction coadministered angiotensin receptor blockers patients essential hypertensionnan,18971536,amlodipine,vascular endothelial dysfunction,"The combination of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers has been shown to be more effective than the individual drugs alone in the treatment of chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine or the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on vascular endothelial function and arteriosclerosis in patients with essential hypertension who had already been receiving angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy. Thirty-two patients with essential hypertension treated with angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy were randomized to receive 5 mg of amlodipine (n=16) or 4 mg of perindopril (n=16) once daily in the morning for 24 weeks. The patients were evaluated before and after therapy to assess changes in blood pressure, flow-mediated vasodilation (a parameter of vascular endothelial function), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (a parameter of arteriosclerosis). Before treatment, there were no significant differences in the above parameters between groups. After treatment, there was a similar significant decrease in blood pressure in both groups. Flow-mediated vasodilation increased significantly in the perindopril group compared with the amlodipine group; however, the decrease in brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was not significantly different between groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril is superior to the calcium channel blocker amlodipine for reducing vascular endothelial dysfunction when co-administered with angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with essential hypertension."
False,newer bps simplify current therapeutic schemes improve costeffectiveness ratio also potential improve therapeutic efficacy least patients aggressive osteolytic disease given adjuvant therapynan,12136223,BPs,aggressive osteolytic disease,"Bisphosphonates (BPs) are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and it is well accepted that tumor cells in bone, especially breast cancer and myeloma cells, can stimulate osteoclast formation and activity leading to the release of growth factors or cytokines, which will further stimulate cancer cells' growth and their secretion of osteolytic factors. BPs are now the standard treatment for cancer hypercalcemia, for which a dose of 90 mg of pamidronate or 1500 mg of clodronate is recommended; the former compound is more potent and has a longer lasting effect. Repeated pamidronate infusions exert clinically relevant analgesic effects in more than half of patients with metastatic bone pain. Recent data suggest that non-responding patients should perhaps be treated with higher doses. The optimal dose actually remains to be defined, especially as it is thought that it is probably a function of the disease stage. Regular pamidronate infusions can also achieve a partial objective response according to conventional UICC criteria and they can almost double the objective response rate to chemotherapy. Lifelong administration of oral clodronate to patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone reduces the frequency of morbid skeletal events by more than one-fourth. Two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials comparing monthly 90 mg pamidronate infusions to placebo infusions for 1-2 years in addition to hormone or chemotherapy in patients with at least one lytic bone metastasis have shown that the mean skeletal morbidity rate could be reduced by 30-40%. The results obtained with intravenous BPs are generally viewed as better than those obtained with oral clodronate. However, preference can be given to the oral route when BPs are started early in the process of metastatic bone disease in a patient receiving hormone therapy. According to the recently published ASCO guidelines, pamidronate 90 mg i.v. delivered over 2 h every 3-4 weeks can be recommended in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have imaging evidence of lytic destruction of bone and who are concurrently receiving systemic therapy with hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Furthermore, the ASCO Panel considered it ""reasonable"" to start i.v. BPs in women with localized pain whose bone scans were abnormal and plain radiographs normal, but not when an abnormal bone scan is asymptomatic. The pertinence of these criteria is discussed below. Because BPs are providing supportive care, reducing the rate of skeletal morbidity but evidently not abolishing it, the criteria for stopping their administration have to be different from those used for classic antineoplastic drugs, and they should not be stopped when metastatic bone disease is progressing. However, criteria to determine whether and for how long an individual patient benefits from their administration are lacking. New biochemical markers of bone resorption might help identify those patients continuing to benefit from therapy. Even better results have been achieved in patients with multiple myeloma, and the general consensus is that BPs should be started as soon as the diagnosis of lytic disease is made in myeloma patients. On the other hand, data are scanty in prostate cancer, but large-scale trials with potent BPs are ongoing or planned in such patients. Similar results to those achieved with pamidronate have been obtained with monthly 6-mg infusions of the newer BP ibandronate in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone. The tolerance of ibandronate could be better, and the drug has the potential to be administered as a 15- to 30-min infusion. Zoledronate can also be administered safely as a 15-min 4-mg infusion, and large scale phase III trials have just been completed. These newer BPs will simplify the current therapeutic schemes and improve the cost-effectiveness ratio; they also have the potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy, at least in patients with an aggressive osteolytic disease or when given as adjuvant therapy. For that matter, initial data with clodronate indicate that they have the potential to prevent the development of bone metastases, but the use of BPs in the adjuvant setting must still be viewed as experimental."

False,determine effectiveness acceptability progestogens alone combination oestrogens regulation irregular menstrual bleeding associated oligoanovulationnan,22972055,oestrogens,menstrual bleeding,"Irregular menstrual bleeding may arise due to exogenous sex steroids, lesions of the genital tract or be associated with anovulation. Irregular bleeding due to oligo/anovulation (previously called dysfunctional uterine bleeding or DUB) is more common at the extremes of reproductive life, and in women with ovulatory disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In anovulatory cycles there may be prolonged oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium without progesterone withdrawal and so cycles are irregular and bleeding may be heavy. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle, in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination, are widely used in the management of irregular menstrual bleeding, but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used vary widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach."

We describe a patient with no previous history of cardiac disease or arrhythmia who developed sustained bigeminy and 2 brief runs of ventricular tachycardia after caffeine administration. Although intravenous caffeine is generally well tolerated, the clinician should be aware of the potential for unpredictable and serious ventricular arrhythmias."
True,risperidone induced mania reported adults therefore increased caution used deciding treat children adolescents risperidone particularly predisposition toward mania nan,11772153,Risperidone,mania,"Antipsychotics are frequently used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Atypical antipsychotics have come to the forefront in child psychiatry due largely to their tolerability profiles as well as their efficacy. Potential treatment options include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. A number of studies investigating the use of clozapine have been published in children; however, owing to the frequent monitoring required for agranulocytosis, the use of clozapine may be restricted to patients with treatment-refractory disease. With accumulating data on the development of glucose intolerance in adults receiving clozapine, closer monitoring of bodyweight and fasting blood glucose is imperative. Clozapine also has an increased seizure risk, therefore a baseline electroencephalogram should be performed, as well as continued vigilance for this adverse effect. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that is generally well tolerated and numerous studies have been published investigating this drug in children. Unlike clozapine, its receptor interaction profile lends itself toward increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinaemia. Bodyweight gain is a common adverse effect, although somewhat less than that reported with olanzapine. Baseline liver function studies prior to initiation of this medication are recommended. Risperidone-induced mania has been reported in adults and, therefore, increased caution should be used when deciding to treat children and adolescents with risperidone, particularly in those with a predisposition toward mania. Olanzapine, like risperidone, has also been associated with onset of mania in adults. Olanzapine has a receptor profile that results in significant risk for bodyweight gain and sedation. Furthermore, this drug has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance; thus, it is important to monitor bodyweight and fasting blood glucose on a frequent basis. Less information is known about quetiapine in children and adolescents. Reports about its efficacy and tolerability vary. Quetiapine appears to have increased risk for sedation and bodyweight gain, albeit less than that of olanzapine. The compound appears to be less likely to induce EPS. Finally, ziprasidone has recently been approved for use in the adult population. This compound, in terms of its receptor profile, has more in common with risperidone. This suggests a potential for increased risk of EPS and hyperprolactinaemia. It also has an increased risk of QTc prolongation; thus, a baseline electrocardiogram is suggested, particularly in those patients with a history of cardiovascular illness. Lack of evidence for bodyweight gain with ziprasidone is a considerable advantage."

Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is increasingly used as an alternative to FEIBA; however, the thrombotic safety profile of rFVIIa remains incompletely characterized. To determine the incidence rates of thrombotic adverse events (AEs) after infusion of rFVIIa and FEIBA. Data from the MedWatch pharmacovigilance program of the US Food and Drug Administration, as supplemented by published case reports, were used in conjunction with estimated numbers of infusions available from manufacturers to assess comparative incidence of thrombotic AEs in patients receiving rFVIIa or FEIBA in the period from April 1999 through June 2002. Reported thrombotic AEs were rare, with incidence rates of 24.6 per 10(5) infusions (CI, 19.1-31.2 per 10(5) infusions) for rFVIIa and 8.24 per 10(5) infusions (CI, 4.71-13.4 per 10(5) infusions) for FEIBA. Thrombotic AEs were significantly more frequent in rFVIIa than FEIBA recipients (incidence rate ratio, 2.98; CI, 1.71-5.52). The most commonly documented single type of thrombotic AE after rFVIIa infusion was cerebrovascular thrombosis, while myocardial infarction was the most frequent type in patients receiving FEIBA. Contrasting AE reporting patterns between rFVIIa and FEIBA may have contributed to the observed difference in thrombotic event incidence. Nevertheless, this comprehensive pharmacovigilance assessment does not support superior thrombotic safety of rFVIIa and suggests that thrombotic AE risk may be higher in rFVIIa than FEIBA recipients."
False,antiarrhythmic plasma concentrations cibenzoline canine ventricular arrhythmias nan,2435991,cibenzoline,ventricular arrhythmias,"Using two-stage coronary ligation-, digitalis-, and adrenaline-induced canine ventricular arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic effects of cibenzoline were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each arrhythmia model was determined. Cibenzoline suppressed all the arrhythmias, and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for arrhythmias induced by 24-h coronary ligation, 48-h coronary ligation, digitalis, and adrenaline were 1.9 +/- 0.9 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 1.6 +/- 0.5 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 0.6 +/- 0.2 (by 2 mg/kg i.v.), and 3.5 +/- 1.3 (by 5 mg/kg i.v.) micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SDM, n = 6-7). The concentration for adrenaline-induced arrhythmia was significantly higher than those for the other types of arrhythmias. This pharmacological profile is similar to those of mexiletine and tocainide, and all three drugs have central nervous system (CNS) stimulant action. Because cibenzoline had only weak hypotensive and sinus node depressive effects and was found to be orally active when given to coronary ligation arrhythmia dogs, its clinical usefulness is expected."
False,rings endothelial function attenuated enzymatic treatment 5-ht caused contractions log ec partially blocked ketanserin nan,8789380,ketanserin,contractions,"1. We investigated the hypothesis that, as in some other large human arteries, 5-HT-induced contraction of the temporal artery is mediated through two co-existing receptor populations, 5-HT1-like- and 5-HT2A. Temporal arterial segments were obtained from patients undergoing brain surgery and rings prepared set up to contract with 5-HT and related agents. Fractions of maximal 5-HT responses mediated through 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2A receptors, f1 and f2 = 1-f1, were estimated by use of the 5-HT2A-selective antagonist ketanserin. 2. In rings with intact endothelium 5-HT evoked contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.0. Ketanserin (10-1000 nM) antagonized part of the 5-HT-induced contractions. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M of 6.9 and f1 of 0.17 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 6.4 and f1 of 0.20 (1000 nM ketanserin). 3. In rings with endothelial function attenuated by enzymatic treatment, 5-HT caused contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.2 that were partially blocked by ketanserin. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M 7.4 and f1 of 0.16 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 7.5 and f1 of 0.14 (1000 nM ketanserin). 4. The ketanserin-resistant component of 5-HT-evoked contraction was blocked by methiothepin (100-1000 nM) consistent with mediation through 5-HT1-like receptors. 5. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT1-like-selective agonist, sumatriptan, caused small contractions with a -log EC50, M of 6.5 and intrinsic activity of 0.21 with respect to 5-HT that were resistant to blockade by 1000 nM ketanserin but antagonized by 100 nM methiothepin. 6. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT2A receptor partial agonist SK&F 103829 (2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-8[methyl sulphonyl]-1H3-benzazepin-7-ol methensulphonate) contracted rings with a -log EC50, M of 5.0 and an intrinsic activity of 0.49 with respect to 5-HT; the effects were antagonized by ketanserin 1000 nM. 7. We conclude that 80-86% of the maximum 5-HT-evoked contraction of human temporal artery is mediated through 5-HT2A receptors, the remainder through 5-HT1-like-receptors, regardless of whether or not endothelium is functional. The 5-HT1-like-receptors are more likely to be 5-HT1D beta receptors than 5-HT1D alpha receptors and sumatriptan is a full agonist for these receptors. As found in arteries of other species, SK&F 103829 is a partial agonist for 5-HT2A receptors of human temporal artery."
False,progestogens without oestrogen irregular uterine bleeding associated anovulation nan,22972055,oestrogen,anovulation,"Irregular menstrual bleeding may arise due to exogenous sex steroids, lesions of the genital tract or be associated with anovulation. Irregular bleeding due to oligo/anovulation (previously called dysfunctional uterine bleeding or DUB) is more common at the extremes of reproductive life, and in women with ovulatory disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In anovulatory cycles there may be prolonged oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium without progesterone withdrawal and so cycles are irregular and bleeding may be heavy. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle, in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination, are widely used in the management of irregular menstrual bleeding, but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used vary widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach."
True,analysis nelfinavir induced endoplasmic reticulum stress nan,21329798,nelfinavir,endoplasmic reticulum stress,"Nelfinavir (Viracept®) is an HIV protease inhibitor that has been shown to induce the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress reaction in human cancer cells. Although the presumed drug doses needed for an efficient ER stress reaction and ensuing apoptosis in cancer cells is somewhat higher than those prescribed for HIV-infected persons, nelfinavir represents one of the few clinically applicable ER stress-inducing agents, and is currently being tested in clinical studies on cancer patients. Therefore, this chapter describes how to obtain and use nelfinavir for in vitro and in vivo studies. In addition, methods are described that might facilitate the analysis and monitoring of the nelfinavir-induced ER stress response either in cancer cells in cell culture or in cancer tissue biopsies. These methods include various fluorescence-based ER staining techniques and the expression analysis of primary and secondary ER stress markers by immunoblotting and RT-PCR analysis. Among the several methods presented, the analysis of an unconventional XBP1 splicing, caused by the ER stress sensor IRE1, is shown to present the most sensitive and most specific marker for nelfinavir-induced ER stress. Primers and PCR conditions suitable for XBP1 PCR and splicing analysis are presented. Such a PCR-based XBP1 splicing analysis might not only be suitable to monitor nelfinavir-induced ER stress, but could also be applied in drug screening programs to test for other ER stress-inducing agents with similar activities or synergistic activities with nelfinavir."
True,methotrexate remissioninducing drug may doselimiting toxicity nan,11304108,Methotrexate,toxicity,"Because of radiographic evidence of progressive bone loss and the inability to eliminate synovial proliferation with methotrexate, it became apparent that therapy for rheumatoid arthritis needed further advancement. Methotrexate is not a remission-inducing drug and may have dose-limiting toxicity. In the past 2 years, three new disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been approved: leflunomide, etanercept, and infliximab. Each of these agents has demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo in randomized, controlled studies. Because methotrexate had a dominant therapeutic role, the new drugs were also studied in combination with it. Other established DMARDs, such as sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine, have also demonstrated efficacy when used together with methotrexate. The results of these combination studies clearly demonstrate that clinical responses can be meaningfully improved when new and existing DMARDs are added to methotrexate. Although toxicity remains a serious concern when powerful immune modulators and antimetabolites are used in combination, relatively few serious adverse events have been reported during 2-year treatment periods. It has also become apparent that combinations of new DMARDs and methotrexate virtually halt radiographic progression over 2 years. The new agents are expensive, but annual costs must be weighed against the personal and societal expense of joint arthroplasty, hospitalizations, disability, and diminished quality of life that accompanies poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. The ultimate value of combination DMARD therapy with methotrexate will be determined by long-term data on safety, efficacy, and effects on radiographic deterioration of bone. Additional long-term observational data on the incidence of joint arthroplasty and disability will help to place the issue of societal costs in a better perspective. This will allow the value of aggressive treatment to be established with certainty."
False,efficacy ccb amlodipine arb valsartan lowering bp protecting cardiovascular events stroke across range hypertensive patient populations established many yearsnan,20626210,valsartan,stroke,"Early initiation of rational and effective combination therapy consisting of antihypertensive drugs with two different and complementary mechanisms of actions is increasingly becoming accepted in clinical practice and by guidelines as a first-line approach to control blood pressure (BP) and prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Once-daily combination therapy provides more rapid control of BP, which is important for preventing cardiovascular events, with similar or improved tolerability compared with the component monotherapies, and improved adherence because of regimen simplification. Combination therapy with a calcium channel antagonist (calcium channel blocker [CCB]) and an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a rational approach to achieve BP goals and provide protection against renal and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A number of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations, including CCB/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and CCB/ angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) combinations are available as fixed-dose formulations. There is substantial evidence for the BP-lowering efficacy of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations in diverse patient populations, and their use in combination is associated with favourable tolerability and fewer adverse metabolic effects than some other combination therapies. Recent evidence from large outcome trials supports the use of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations for reducing the risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly in high-risk patients, together with evidence that the benefits of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations may extend beyond their efficacy in lowering BP in terms of protecting against fatal and nonfatal stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related deaths. The efficacy of the CCB amlodipine and the ARB valsartan in lowering BP and protecting against cardiovascular events and stroke across a range of hypertensive patient populations has been established over many years. Fixed-dose amlodipine/valsartan combinations are available in many countries and have shown greater BP reductions and better BP control than the respective monotherapies in diverse patient populations, together with a favourable tolerability profile. Once-daily amlodipine/valsartan is a rational and convenient treatment option for the effective management of patients with hypertension, improving adherence to antihypertensive medication and protecting against cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality."
False,retinoids microm also inhibited dosedependent way degranulation induced fmlp upto highest concentration ra nan,1667243,retinoids,RA,"Retinoids exhibit a wide spectrum of activities, including antiinflammatory properties. We have investigated the effect of retinoic acid (RA) and retinyl acetate (RAc) on the production of reactive oxygen metabolites and the release of lysosomal enzymes by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Incubation of PMN with RAc or RA (1-100 microM) caused a dose-dependent inhibition (upto 90%) in O2- production and chemiluminescence induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylanaline (fMLP), opsonized zymosan or ionophore A23187. Both retinoids (1-100 microM) also inhibited, in a dose-dependent way, degranulation induced by fMLP (upto 85% at the highest concentration of RA). These inhibitory effects appear irreversible, since they persist after the drugs are removed and the cells washed before stimulation. Inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase activity such as acetylsalicyclic acid and indomethacin did not influence the effects of RAc. In contrast, BW755, an inhibitor of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, reversed the inhibitory action of RAc, suggesting that the effect of retinoids occurs possibly through the mediation of lipoxygenase products. The modulation of PMN oxidative metabolism and degranulation might help explain the antiinflammatory properties of retinoids."
False,metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicinmediated acute renal failure nan,20164825,Metformin,acute renal failure,"The antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular dysfunction even in nondiabetic patients. Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin toxicity. Mitochondrial analysis, respiration intensity, levels of reactive oxygen species, permeability transition, and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after gentamicin administration. Metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin-mediated acute renal failure. This was accompanied by a lower activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems. Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration. These in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function. We found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components (cytochrome c, NADH), probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores. These injuries, partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain, were significantly decreased by metformin. Thus, our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can lessen gentamicin nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis."
True,photodistributed nifedipine induced facial telangiectasia nan,8251368,nifedipine,telangiectasia,"Five months after starting nifedipine (Adalat), two patients developed photodistributed facial telangiectasia, which became more noticeable with time. Neither patient complained of photosensitivity or flushing. Both patients reported a significant cosmetic improvement after discontinuing the drug. One commenced the closely related drug amlodipine 3 years later, with recurrence of telangiectasia. The photodistribution of the telangiectasia suggests a significant drug/light interaction."
False,three criteria metabolic syndrome high triglyceride levels glucose intolerance obesity fulfilled three subjects nan,16189445,glucose,obesity,"The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of potent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. To provide information on the late complications of chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the authors prospectively studied the frequency of overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome in survivors of ALL in the initial years after the completion of therapy. Children and adolescents were classified as having the metabolic syndrome if they met three or more of the following criteria: hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), high fasting glucose, obesity, and hypertension. Obesity was defined on the basis of Body Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m2) standard deviation scores or z-scores. Cutoff points for triglycerides and HDL were taken from equivalent pediatric percentiles with the cutoff points proposed by the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII). Hyperglycemia was defined using the ATPIII cutoff points. Elevated systolic or diastolic blood pressure was defined as a value greater than the 95th percentile for age, gender, and height. Fifty-two subjects (29 male and 23 female) with a median age of 15.2 years (range 6.1-22.6 years) were evaluated. Median interval since completion of therapy was 37 months (range 13-121 months). All of them had been treated according to the ALL-BFM 90 chemotherapy protocol and none had received cranial radiotherapy. Of the 52 subjects, 25 (48%) were overweight (BMI z-score >1.5) and 3 (5.76%) were obese (BMI z-score >2); among them, 1 was severely obese (BMI z-score >2.5). Three criteria for the metabolic syndrome (high triglyceride levels, glucose intolerance, and obesity) were fulfilled by three subjects (5.76%). Twenty-nine subjects (55.7%) had at least one risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Hyperglycemia and hypertension were infrequent. Prompt recognition of the risk factors for metabolic syndrome and intervention seem mandatory to ensure early prevention of cardiovascular disease in survivors of ALL."
True,vitro findings suggest cardiac surgical patients may increased risk cyanide toxicity response perioperative administration sodium nitroprusside nan,17578949,sodium nitroprusside,toxicity,"Cyanide toxicity is a complication of sodium nitroprusside administration. Cardiac surgery may increase the risk of cyanide toxicity, because hemolysis during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may catalyze the release of free cyanide from sodium nitroprusside."
True,apparent calcium chloride dissociate vocalization fighting autonomic motor phenomena mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsions caused carbachol eserinenan,6892185,carbachol,tremor,"The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."

The objective of this study was to determine the percentage of women who developed uterine cancer more than 12 months after discontinuing tamoxifen (past users) and to compare their clinical and pathologic features with those of women who developed uterine cancer while on tamoxifen therapy or within 12 months of stopping therapy (recent users).
False,oxaliplatin platinum compound characterized diaminocyclohexane dach platinum carrier ligand proven efficacy first secondline advanced colorectal cancer crc treatmentnan,12398998,platinum,CRC/colorectal cancer,"Oxaliplatin, a platinum compound characterized by a diaminocyclohexane (DACH) platinum carrier ligand, has proven its efficacy in first- and second-line advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. Acute reversible and cumulative peripheral sensory neuropathy has been observed frequently with oxaliplatin treatment and limits its use. Its synergism with other drugs, as well as its different mechanism of action and toxicity profile make it an attractive candidate for combination studies in CRC. It can be combined safely with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)+/-folinic acid (LV), irinotecan, raltitrexed, multitarget antifolate LY231514 (MTA), and oral 5-FU prodrugs. These combinations confer both an increased response rate compared to that of any single agent and an increased secondary surgical resection of initially unresectable metastases, possibly leading to prolonged survival. In three prospective randomized phase III studies in advanced CRC, oxaliplatin plus 5-FU/LV improved significantly progression-free survival without a significant increase in median survival time and without affecting quality of life, compared to treatment with 5-FU/LV. Ongoing clinical trials will define its role in the adjuvant setting."
False,intraoperative intrapleural ipl cisplatin cddp treatment thoracotomy performed esophageal cancers nan,11295088,cisplatin/CDDP,cancers,"Intraoperative intrapleural (i.pl.) cisplatin (CDDP) treatment during thoracotomy was performed for esophageal cancers. Three patients underwent isotonic (308 mOsm/l) CDDP treatment. Hypotonic CDDP treatments with a 154 mOsm/l solution and a 62 mOsm/l solution were administered to 4 and 9 patients, respectively. The maximum concentrations (Cmax) of both total and filterable platinum in the plasma after injection of the hypotonic solution were significantly higher than those after injection of the isotonic solution. The area under the curve of concentration versus time (AUC) of the plasma of the 62 mOsm/l solution was significantly higher than that of the 154 mOsm/l and isotonic solution. Although higher levels of the Cmax may increase side-effects, the hypotonic condition of the i.pl. fluid and increased AUC in the plasma may escalate the accumulation of platinum in i.pl. cancer cells. These results suggest that hypotonic i.pl. CDDP is tolerable and may be useful for treatment of the incipient phase of pleural carcinomatosis and for prophylaxis of postoperative recurrence."
False,order study role calcium ions pathogenesis vasoconstrictive lesions caused acute smoking author studied peripheral vascular effects calciumchannel antagonist nifedipine dihydropyridine derivative calcitonin hypocalcemizing hormone possess vasoactive actions elderly regular smokers mean age yearsnan,2226675,dihydropyridine,hypocalcemizing,"Aging is characterized, besides other changes, by a progressive increase in calcium content in the arterial wall, which is enhanced by diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, arterial hypertension, and tabagism. As to tabagism, experiments in animals have shown that nicotine can increase calcium content of the arterial wall, and clinical studies have demonstrated that cigarette smoking induces peripheral vasoconstriction, with consequent increase in blood pressure levels. In order to study the role of calcium ions in the pathogenesis of the vasoconstrictive lesions caused by ""acute"" smoking, the author has studied the peripheral vascular effects of the calcium-channel antagonist nifedipine, a dihydropyridine derivative, and calcitonin, a hypocalcemizing hormone which possess vasoactive actions on 12 elderly regular smokers (mean age 65.8 years). The results demonstrated that both nifedipine (10 mg sublingually 20 min before smoking) and salmon calcitonin (100 MRC U/daily intramuscularly for three days) are able to prevent peripheral vasoconstriction evaluated by Doppler velocimetry, as well as the increase of blood pressure induced by smoking. On the basis of our results, the author proposes that cigarette smoking-induced vasoconstriction is a calcium-mediated process, which can be hindered by drugs with calcium antagonist action."

True,significant decrease eno nocturnal asthma may reflect important chronobiological defect endogenous production andor increased disposition nitric oxide view bronchodilator action could play role nocturnal exacerbations asthma nan,10461936,nitric oxide,asthma,"Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation and shows a circadian variation with nocturnal exacerbations. Because exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) measurement appears to be a noninvasive marker of airway inflammation, we examined the hypothesis that ENO would increase at night. In five nocturnal and five non-nocturnal asthmatics, ENO was measured at 4 P.M., 10 P.M., and 4 A.M. before and after bronchodilator. Both pre- and post-bronchodilator ENO (mean pre- and post-bronchodilator +/- SEM, ppb) unexpectedly fell significantly in nocturnal asthma from 4 P.M. (77.2 +/- 8.2) compared to 10 P.M. (68.4 +/- 8.7, p < 0.003) and 4 A.M. (66.0 +/- 8.5, p < 0.001) with no significant difference between 10 P.M. and 4 A.M.. In contrast, there were no significant differences in mean ENO at 4 P.M., 10 P.M., and 4 A.M. in non-nocturnal asthma. (51.3 +/- 10.8, 57.7 +/- 13.4, 53.8 +/- 12.5 ppb, respectively). Following bronchodilator, ENO rose significantly by 10.5 +/- 1.8 ppb in the nocturnal asthma group alone. The circadian rhythm of ENO differed greatly between nocturnal and non-nocturnal asthma. The significant decrease in ENO in nocturnal asthma may reflect an important chronobiological defect in the endogenous production and/or increased disposition of nitric oxide, which in view of its bronchodilator action, could play a role in nocturnal exacerbations of asthma."
False,pulmonary exchange differ significantly subgroups cf patients without chronic pseudomonas aeruginosa infection nan,19669109,NO,Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection,"In cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is not raised, but rather is normal or even decreased when measured at a single expiratory flow. FeNO measurements at several flow rates allow differentiation between alveolar and bronchial nitric oxide (NO) production. Extended FeNO measurements therefore should be useful to localize the FeNO deficit in CF airways. FeNO was measured in stable CF adults with moderate lung disease and in healthy controls. Bronchial NO fluxes (J(NO,Br)) and alveolar NO concentrations (C(Alv)) were calculated from FeNO measurements at flow rates of 100, 150 and 200 ml/s using a method previously described. Thirty-two adults were included in the study, 12 of whom had CF. CF adults had significantly lower FeNO values at all flow rates. The median J(NO,Br) was significantly lower in CF adults than in healthy controls [0.31 nl/s (range = 0.11-0.63) vs. 0.70 nl/s (0.27-3.52); P < 0.001], while the median C(Alv) was similar in both groups [1.7 ppb (0.3-3.9) vs. 1.2 (0.1-5.2)]. Pulmonary NO exchange did not differ significantly between subgroups of CF patients with and without chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. No significant correlation was detectable between FEV(1)/VC and J(NO,Br) and C(Alv), respectively. Extended FeNO measurements can separate alveolar and bronchial NO outputs in CF adults. The lower FeNO in adults with moderate to severe CF lung disease is likely to be the result of lower bronchial NO output."

True,acetaminophen poisoned cats develop methemoglobinemia sometimes hepatic failure nan,8585668,Acetaminophen,hepatic failure,"Acetaminophen is widely used in human beings for analgesic purposes, but is one of the most frequent causes of poisoning in cats. Acetaminophen-poisoned cats develop methemoglobinemia and sometimes hepatic failure. To determine the benefit of using methylene blue, a treatment for methemoglobinemia, along with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the recommended treatment for acetaminophen-poisoned cats, groups of 3 male and 3 female cats each were given methylene blue NAC, or both after administration of acetaminophen (120 mg/kg of body weight, PO). Male cats seemed more susceptible than female cats to acetaminophen toxicosis, because 3 males died of hepatic failure (2 cats given acetaminophen/methylene blue and 1 given acetaminophen/NAC/methylene blue). Although NAC alone seemed to elicit the best overall response, methylene blue, alone or in combination with NAC, may be useful in female cats."
False,ten asthmatic subjects studied three occasions bronchial challenges aerosolized paf methacholine isotonic salinenan,1661723,methacholine,asthmatic,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent bronchoconstrictor in humans and has been implicated as an inflammatory mediator in asthma. This study was performed to evaluate whether PAF-induced bronchoconstriction in vivo could be mediated through the release of the bronchoconstrictor eicosanoids, thromboxane (Tx) A2 and the cysteinyl leukotrienes. Ten asthmatic subjects were studied on three occasions after bronchial challenges with aerosolized PAF, methacholine, or isotonic saline. PAF caused bronchoconstriction in all 10 subjects (mean maximal percent fall in specific airway conductance 48.2 +/- 4.6) and was matched by methacholine challenge. Saline caused no changes in specific airway conductance. Urinary leukotriene E4 was significantly elevated after inhaled PAF (366.0 +/- 66.9 ng/mmol creatinine, P less than 0.01) compared with methacholine (41.6 +/- 13.3) and saline (33.6 +/- 4.6). The major urinary TxA2 metabolite 2,3-dinor TxB2 was elevated after inhaled PAF (41.3 +/- 7.1 ng/mmol creatinine, P less than 0.01) compared with methacholine (14.0 +/- 2.7) and saline (17.1 +/- 3.9). Urinary 2,3-dinor 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha after PAF (22.2 +/- 1.4) was raised with respect to the methacholine challenge (13.9 +/- 1.8, P less than 0.02), although no significant increase was observed compared with the saline control (18.6 +/- 3.3). Inhaled PAF leads to the secondary generation of cysteinyl leukotrienes and TxA2, and it is possible that these mediate some of the acute effects of inhaled PAF in vivo."

We report on the management of six patients who developed diabetes mellitus following treatment with olanzapine, five of whom had independent risk factors for diabetes. Olanzapine was changed to quetiapine in all patients with improvement in glycaemic control in two patients. In view of the uncertainty of the size and mechanism of the link between olanzapine and diabetes, we discuss issues surrounding routine clinical management and monitoring of patients on antipsychotics and the clinical implications."

The camptothecin derivative irinotecan (CPT-11) has been shown to possess antitumor activity in phase II trials for patients with carcinoma of the lung, cervix, ovary, colon, or rectum and for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The current study was designed to test the efficacy of the drug against a panel of human tumor xenografts derived from adult and pediatric central nervous system malignancies. Tumors included childhood high-grade gliomas (D-212 MG, D-456 MG), adult high-grade gliomas (D-54 MG, D-245 MG), medulloblastomas (D341 Med, D487 Med), ependymomas (D528 EP, D612 EP), and a rhabdomyosarcoma (TE-671), as well as sublines with demonstrated resistance to busulfan (D-456 MG (BR)), cyclophosphamide (TE-671 CR), procarbazine (D-245 MG (PR)) or melphalan (TE-671 MR), growing subcutaneously and intracranially in athymic nude mice. In replicate experiments, CPT-11 was given at a dosage of 40 mg/kg per dose via intraperitoneal injection in 10% dimethylsulfoxide on days 1-5 and 8-12, which is the dosage lethal to 10% of treated animals. CPT-11 produced statistically significant (P < 0.001) growth delays in all subcutaneous xenografts tested, including those resistant to busulfan, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, and melphalan, with growth delays ranging from 21.3 days in D487 Med to 90+ days in several tumor lines. Further, tumor regression was evident in every treated animal bearing a subcutaneous tumor, with some xenografts yielding complete tumor regression. Statistically significant (P < 0.001) increases in survival were demonstrated in the two intracranial xenografts-D341 EP (73.0% increase) and D-456 MG (114.2% increase)-treated with CPT-11. These studies demonstrate that, of over 40 drugs evaluated in this laboratory, CPT-11 is the most active against central nervous system xenografts and should be advanced to clinical trial as soon as possible."

False,reduction plasma estrogens comparable values obtained commonly used aromatase inhibitors may responsible antitumor effects breast cancer nan,9816328,estrogens,breast cancer,"Twelve postmenopausal women suffering from advanced breast cancer had plasma estrogens, androgens, cortisol, and gonadotropins determined before therapy and during treatment with megestrol acetate (MA) in oral doses escalated from 40 to 160 mg. The plasma clearance and production rate of estrone and estrone sulfate were determined before treatment and after 4 weeks of therapy with 160 mg MA. Treatment with MA suppressed plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, and cortisol in a dose-dependent manner to <10% of pretreatment values. Plasma testosterone, estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate were suppressed to 18-29% of pretreatment values, whereas the gonadotropins were suppressed to 35-52%. The plasma clearance rates of estrone and estrone sulfate were increased by a mean value of 23.7% (P < 0.01) and 23.5% (P < 0.025), whereas the production rates were reduced by 76.7% (P < 0.0005) and 76.1% (P < 0.0005), respectively. Our findings indicate that MA causes profound suppression of adrenal steroid production but in addition suppresses ovarian secretion of androgens in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.

In three patients, LTG exacerbated MJ in a dose-dependent manner with early aggravation during titration. MJ disappeared when LTG dose was decreased by 25 to 50%. In two patients, LTG exacerbated MJ in a delayed but more severe manner, with myoclonic status that only ceased after LTG withdrawal."
True,findings indicate presence high concentrations pfoa long times hepg cells undergo primary secondary necrosis nan,10590214,PFOA,necrosis,"The effects of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a potent hepatocarcinogen and peroxisome proliferator in rodents, on human cells have not yet been examined. In the present study we demonstrate that treatment of human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells with PFOA induces apoptosis, as well as perturbs the cell cycle. This apoptosis was characterized by electron microscopy, which revealed typical nucleosomal fragmentation (also observed as a 'DNA ladder' upon electrophoresis on agarose) and was quantitated using propidium iodide staining of cellular DNA and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. This process was dose- and time-dependent: apoptosis became manifest with 200 microM and maximal (45% of the cells) upon exposure to 450 microM PFOA for 24 h. Electrophoresis of the DNA from HepG2 cells exposed to 500 microM PFOA for 24 h or to 400 microM PFOA for 48 h revealed a smear typical of non-specific degradation. These findings indicate that in the presence of high concentrations of PFOA for long times, HepG2 cells undergo primary and secondary necrosis. Quantitation of trypan blue exclusion supported this conclusion. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the cell cycle of HepG2 cells was perturbed by exposure to 50-150 microM PFOA. A 50 microM concentration resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of G(2)/M cells and, simultaneously, a decrease in the number of cells in the S phase, whereas treatment with 100 or 150 microM PFOA increased the proportion of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase and decreased the number of cells in the G(2)/M and S phases. Simultaneous flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis-associated DNA strand breaks using the TUNEL procedure and of propidium iodide staining of cellular DNA revealed DNA breaks in HepG2 cells exposed to 150 microM PFOA, prior to nuclear fragmentation."

In the field of palliative care, pruritus is a symptom occurring in patients with disparate underlying diseases and based on different pathologic mechanisms but ending in the same phenomenon. The pathogenesis of pruritus is complex and not fully elucidated. Thus, it is still very difficult to treat pruritus effectively. Evidence-based treatment approaches are needed."
False,use adriamycin adr cancer chemotherapy limited due cumulative cardiovascular toxicitynan,9952311,ADR/adriamycin,cancer,"The use of adriamycin (ADR) in cancer chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative cardiovascular toxicity. Earlier observations that ADR interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate ADR's action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb-c mice i.p. treated with ADR for several weeks. At various times during treatment, the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy. In parallel, total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady-state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII, COXIII, and COXIV genes. Similarly, samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies. Our results indicated that 1) treatment of mice with ADR caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia, extension of ventricular depolarization time (tQRS), and failure of QRS at high concentrations (10-14 mg/kg body weight cumulative dose); 2) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling, fusion, dissolution, and/or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment. Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue; and 3) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined, only COXII gene expression was suppressed by ADR treatment, mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver. Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40% of heart muscle by weight, we conclude that the deteriorating effects of ADR on cardiovascular function involve mitochondrial structural and functional impairment."
True,progressive granulomatous pneumonitis response cosmetic subcutaneous silicone injections patient hiv infection case report review literaturenan,22288970,silicone,granulomatous pneumonitis,"Silicone, commonly used in cosmetic procedures owing to its presumed inertness, can yield serious sequelae including acute embolization and pneumonitis. Chronic pulmonary sequelae in response to silicone injection have not been previously described. We report a case of chronic progressive granulomatous pneumonitis in response to subcutaneous silicone injections in a transgender male-to-female patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). After receiving silicone injections to the buttock, the patient developed rapid onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and chills. Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse peripheral interstitial opacities. She responded symptomatically to prednisone with subsequent intermittent symptomatic flares. Four years later, she developed marked dyspnea and cough. Chest computed tomography showed progressive diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities. Lung biopsies demonstrated numerous spheroid silicone particles within the lung interstitium and small pulmonary vessels, surrounded by foreign body giant cells and nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation. We speculate that HIV-1-infected patients may be at risk for chronic, progressive granulomatous pneumonitis due to silicone injection years after their procedure owing to shifting levels of cell-mediated immunity."
True,environmental impact associated resource depletion human toxicity mainly associated cobalt copper nickel thallium silver whereas ecotoxicity potential primarily associated cobalt copper nickel thallium silvernan,23638841,copper,toxicity,"Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-polymer (Li-poly) batteries have recently become dominant in consumer electronic products because of advantages associated with energy density and product longevity. However, the small size of these batteries, the high rate of disposal of consumer products in which they are used, and the lack of uniform regulatory policy on their disposal means that lithium batteries may contribute substantially to environmental pollution and adverse human health impacts due to potentially toxic materials. In this research, we used standardized leaching tests, life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and hazard assessment models to evaluate hazardous waste classification, resource depletion potential, and toxicity potentials of lithium batteries used in cellphones. Our results demonstrate that according to U.S. federal regulations, defunct Li-ion batteries are classified hazardous due to their lead (Pb) content (average 6.29 mg/L; σ = 11.1; limit 5). However, according to California regulations, all lithium batteries tested are classified hazardous due to excessive levels of cobalt (average 163,544 mg/kg; σ = 62,897; limit 8000), copper (average 98,694 mg/kg; σ = 28,734; limit 2500), and nickel (average 9525 mg/kg; σ = 11,438; limit 2000). In some of the Li-ion batteries, the leached concentrations of chromium, lead, and thallium exceeded the California regulation limits. The environmental impact associated with resource depletion and human toxicity is mainly associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver, whereas the ecotoxicity potential is primarily associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver. However, the relative contribution of aluminum and lithium to human toxicity and ecotoxicity could not be estimated due to insufficient toxicity data in the models. These findings support the need for stronger government policy at the local, national, and international levels to encourage recovery, recycling, and reuse of lithium battery materials."

Included are data from current or recently completed studies conducted by major pediatric oncology cooperative groups and large individual oncology centers for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent tumors. Sarcomas, neuroblastoma, lymphomas, recurrent solid tumors, brain tumors, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia are discussed. Randomized trials to determine the relative efficacy of ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide in various childhood malignancies are under way. The long-term consequences of ifosfamide in survivors of childhood cancer, in terms of development of bladder cancer or other malignancies thought to be associated with alkylating agents, are not known, and will only be determined through follow-up studies of adult survivors. Ifosfamide's future role in pediatric oncology will depend on evaluation of its therapeutic benefits against long-term toxicity."

Liver involvement as a part of disseminated histoplasmosis is well known; however, isolated hepatic histoplasmosis without any other stigmata of dissemination is extremely rare and the literature is limited to only two case reports. We present a rare case of isolated granulomatous hepatitis due to histoplasmosis in a 35-year-old female with dermatomyositis receiving low-dose prednisone and methotrexate. There was no evidence of fungal dissemination elsewhere. High clinical suspicion is critical for early diagnosis and treatment."
False,characteristic low serum testosterone concentrations observed obese men also present men metabolic syndrome type diabetes mellitusnan,18843273,testosterone,metabolic syndrome,"Obesity is an important risk factor for many common diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, cancer and erectile dysfunction (ED). Adipose tissues produce a number of adipokines and cytokines, which affect endothelial and metabolic function resulting in insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (risks factors for CVD). Both ED and metabolic syndrome improve with a reduction in body mass index (BMI). The relationships among obesity, metabolic syndrome, ED, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and serum total and free testosterone levels are complex and often confusing to the physician. It is known that BMI is inversely proportional to serum total testosterone concentrations; low serum SHBG levels in obesity contribute to the low serum total testosterone. Recent studies show that BMI is also inversely proportional to free testosterone concentration. The characteristic low serum testosterone concentrations observed in obese men are also present in men with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. A small proportion of men with ED have hypogonadism; however, the proportion increases if these men are obese with manifestations of the metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus. ED is a common symptom in patients with type 2 diabetes who also have low testosterone levels. This review describes the relationships between low serum testosterone concentrations and ED in obese patients and those with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus."
False,characterize spatial distribution ability th selectively target hypoxic regions complement effect doxorubicin docetaxel modifying biomarker distributionnan,24338277,doxorubicin,hypoxic,"Many chemotherapy drugs have poor therapeutic activity in regions distant from tumor blood vessels because of poor tissue penetration and low cytotoxic activity against slowly-proliferating cells. The hypoxia-activated pro-drug TH-302 may have selective toxicity for hypoxic and neighboring cells in tumors. Here we characterize the spatial distribution and ability of TH-302 to selectively target hypoxic regions and complement the effect of doxorubicin and docetaxel by modifying biomarker distribution. Athymic nude mice bearing human breast MCF-7 or prostate PC-3 tumors were treated with doxorubicin or docetaxel respectively and TH-302 alone or in combination. Biomarkers of drug effect including γH2aX (a marker of DNA damage), cleaved caspase-3 or -6 (markers of apoptosis) and reduction in Ki-67 (a marker of cell proliferation) were quantified in tumor sections in relation to functional blood vessels (recognized by DiOC7) and hypoxia (recognized by EF5) using immunohistochemistry. γH2aX expression at 10 min and cleaved caspase-3 or -6 at 24 hr after doxorubicin or docetaxel decreased with increasing distance from tumor blood vessels, with minimal expression in hypoxic regions; maximum reduction in Ki67 levels was observed in regions closest to vasculature at 24 hr. TH-302 induced maximal cell damage in hypoxic and neighboring regions, but was also active in tumor regions closer to blood vessels. TH-302 given 4 hr before doxorubicin or docetaxel increased DNA damage and apoptosis throughout the tumor compared to chemotherapy alone. When given with doxorubicin or docetaxel, TH-302 complements and enhances anticancer effects in both perivascular and hypoxic regions but also increases toxicity."

It is increasingly found in liquid soaps particularly in industry and specifically in the health care environment. Even as a wash-off product, this allergen can be a hidden cause of allergic contact dermatitis."
True,compared oral opioids advantages transdermal fentanyl include lower incidence impact adverse effects constipation nausea vomiting daytime drowsiness higher degree patient satisfaction improved quality life improved convenience compliance resulting administration every hours decreased use rescue medicationnan,14583070,fentanyl,vomiting,"Transdermal fentanyl is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of chronic pain caused by malignancy and non-malignant conditions when administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Compared with oral opioids, the advantages of transdermal fentanyl include a lower incidence and impact of adverse effects (constipation, nausea and vomiting, and daytime drowsiness), a higher degree of patient satisfaction, improved quality of life, improved convenience and compliance resulting from administration every 72 hours, and decreased use of rescue medication. Transdermal fentanyl is a useful analgesic for cancer patients who are unable to swallow or have gastrointestinal problems. Transdermal fentanyl forms a depot within the upper skin layers before entering the microcirculation. Therapeutic blood levels are attained 12-16 hours after patch application and decrease slowly with a half-life of 16-22 hours following removal. Patients with chronic pain should be titrated to adequate relief with short-acting oral or parenteral opioids prior to the initiation of transdermal fentanyl in order to prevent exacerbations of pain or opioid-related adverse effects. Transdermal fentanyl can then be initiated based on the 24-hour opioid requirement once adequate analgesia has been achieved. The prolonged elimination of transdermal fentanyl can become problematic if patients develop opioid-related adverse effects, especially hypoventilation. Adverse effects do not improve immediately after patch removal and may take many hours to resolve. Patients who experience opioid-related toxicity associated with respiratory depression should be treated immediately with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone and closely monitored for at least 24 hours. Because of the short half-life of naloxone, sequential doses or a continuous infusion of the opioid antagonist may be necessary. Transdermal fentanyl should be administered cautiously to patients with pre-existing conditions such as emphysema that may predispose them to the development of hypoventilation. Transdermal fentanyl is indicated only for patients who require continuous opioid administration for the treatment of chronic pain that cannot be managed with other medications. It is contraindicated in the management of acute and postoperative pain, as pain may decrease more rapidly in these circumstances than fentanyl blood levels can be adjusted, leading to the development of life-threatening hypoventilation. Cognitive and physical impairments such as confusion and abnormal co-ordination can occur with transdermal fentanyl. Therefore, patients should be instructed to refrain from driving or operating machinery immediately following the initiation of transdermal fentanyl, or after any dosage increase. Patients may resume such activities once the absence of these potential adverse effects is documented."

True,compound also reported active convulsions induced bicuculline picrotoxin strychninenan,11060714,picrotoxin,convulsions,"Zaleplon (N-[3-(3-cyanopyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidin-7-yl) phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide) is a non-benzodiazepine recently introduced for clinical use. This agent is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Preclinical studies have shown that the benzodiazepines triazolam and Ro17-1812 can substitute for zaleplon in animals trained to distinguish zaleplon from saline. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can antagonise the discriminative stimulus effect of zaleplon. These findings suggest that zaleplon is recognised by animals as a benzodiazepine agent. Zaleplon is active after ip. and oral administration in a variety of motor performance tests, including locomotor activity, rotarod and the loaded grid. Zaleplon has been shown to be active in a number of different anticonvulsant models, including the pentylenetetrazole, isoniazid and electroshock models. The compound is also reported to be active against convulsions induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin and strychnine. Studies in anxiolytic models suggest that zaleplon may have weak anxiolytic activity. From preclinical studies, it appears zaleplon possesses a reduced risk of tolerance compared to triazolam, is less likely to potentiate the effects of ethanol and is unlikely to produce amnestic effects. In man, zaleplon is rapidly absorbed and undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism. The compound has a plasma half-life of approximately one hour and is metabolised primarily via the aldehyde oxidase system to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. This metabolite, along with other minor metabolites formed in vivo, do not appear to contribute to the activity of zaleplon. Metabolites of zaleplon are excreted primarily via the urine. Phase I studies suggest that single daytime doses of zaleplon up to 15 mg are well-tolerated. Short-term impairment of performance occurs when zaleplon is administered during the day at doses epsilon 20 mg. However, given the short half-life of the compound, significant impairment of daytime performance is unlikely if zaleplon is administered at bedtime or shortly after retiring for the evening. Results from Phase II/III studies suggest that zaleplon (5 - 20 mg) produces a dose-dependent reduction in sleep latency in patients suffering from primary insomnia. The clinical efficacy of zaleplon persists for at least four weeks at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. Studies in patients with a history of drug abuse suggest that the abuse potential of zaleplon (at doses above the therapeutic dose range) is similar to that seen with the benzodiazepine triazolam."

True,mitomycin associated hemolytic uremic syndrome hus potentially fatal uncommon condition yet widely recognisednan,3108839,Mitomycin C,Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/HUS,"Mitomycin C associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised. It consists of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with mitomycin C treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent. The renal failure usually develops about 8-10 mth after start of mitomycin C treatment and the mortality is approximately 60% from renal failure or pulmonary edema. Renal lesions are similar to those seen in idiopathic HUS and include arteriolar fibrin thrombi, expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls, ischemic wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis. The mechanism of action is postulated as mitomycin C-induced endothelial cell damage. We describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr-old man with gastric adenocarcinoma who developed renal failure and thrombocytopenia while on treatment with mitomycin C and died in pulmonary edema."
False,present study aimed determine whether erk akt pathways contribute cisplatin resistance human small cell lung cancer cellsnan,23783141,cisplatin,small cell lung cancer,"Cisplatin is widely used for the treatment of solid tumours including small cell lung cancers, but its success is often compromised by relapse and resistance to further treatment. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt are two major cell survival pathways that are upregulated and activated in lung cancer tissues. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and Akt (p-Akt) can be further stimulated by chemotherapeutics in cancer cells. Although individually targeting the ERK1/2 or Akt pathway has been reported to sensitize cancer cells to therapy, the effect of concurrently blocking these two pathways on the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to cisplatin has not been investigated. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways contribute to cisplatin resistance in human small cell lung cancer A549 cells. The results showed that cisplatin activates p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt in A549 cells. Blockade of either of these pathways with chemical inhibitors moderately sensitized A549 cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and reduced cell viability. Strikingly, concurrent inhibition of p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt significantly potentiated cisplatin cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. The sensitization of A549 cells to cisplatin cytotoxicity induced by p-Akt inhibition was mediated by the upregulation of PUMA, whereas that induced by p-ERK1/2 inhibition occurred by Bcl-2 downregulation. These data indicate that the cooperative effects of p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt on attenuating cisplatin cytotoxicity are mediated by PUMA and Bcl-2 regulation, and concurrently blocking these pathways may be an effective strategy for improving the efficacy of cisplatin as anticancer treatment."
False,eleven patients eight hcl two bcl responded pentostatin nan,1564958,pentostatin,HCL,"Similar to interferon alpha, pentostatin is highly effective in hairy cell leukemia and moderately active in other chronic lymphoid malignancies. In ten patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and seven patients with other B-cell chronic leukemias (BCL), we have studied the intracellular 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2,5OAS) activity of the mononuclear cells before, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after pentostatin administration. In patients with HCL the median level of intracellular 2,5OAS increased 4.6-fold at 4 h and 11.5-fold at 24 h compared to the pretreatment value. Among the other seven patients, the median intracellular 2,5OAS remained unchanged in three patients and rose slightly by 2 to 14 times in four patients. Eleven patients (eight with HCL and two with BCL) responded to pentostatin. The median increase in 2,5OAS among the responders was 13.0-fold (range 4.8-30.0) whereas that among non-responders was 2.2-fold (range 0.2-6.3). The difference was highly significant (p less than 0.0001). In five of the total seventeen patients, the plasma levels of 2,5OAS activity were also determined and changes in plasma levels paralleled those measured intracellularly. To determine if the elevation of 2,5OAS is mediated by induction of interferon alpha, the expressions of mRNA for interferon alpha and beta were investigated by means of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction using the corresponding sense primers. In none of the five patients thus studied could we find an induction of mRNA for interferon alpha or beta in the leukemic cells during treatment with pentostatin. Thus, response to pentostatin correlates with induction of 2,5OAS directly and the 2',5'-oligoadenylate system seems to be involved in cytotoxicity."

True,patterns dietary intake serum carotenoid tocopherol status associated biomarkers chronic lowgrade systemic inflammation cardiovascular risknan,25313576,tocopherol,inflammation,"Dietary modification may affect inflammatory processes and protect against chronic disease. In the present study, we examined the relationship between dietary patterns, circulating carotenoid and tocopherol concentrations, and biomarkers of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation in a 10-year longitudinal study of Scottish postmenopausal women. Diet was assessed by FFQ during 1997-2000 (n 3237, mean age 54·8 (SD 2·2) years). Participants (n 2130, mean age 66·0 (SD 2·2) years) returned during 2007-11 for follow-up. Diet was assessed by FFQ (n 1682) and blood was collected for the analysis of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), IL-6, serum amyloid A, E-selectin, lipid profile and dietary biomarkers (carotenoids, tocopherols and retinol). Dietary pattern and dietary biomarker (serum carotenoid) components were generated by principal components analysis. A past 'prudent' dietary pattern predicted serum concentrations of hs-CRP and IL-6 (which decreased across the quintiles of the dietary pattern; P= 0·002 and P= 0·001, respectively; ANCOVA). Contemporary dietary patterns were also associated with inflammatory biomarkers. The concentrations of hs-CRP and IL-6 decreased across the quintiles of the 'prudent' dietary pattern (P= 0·030 and P= 0·006, respectively). hs-CRP concentration increased across the quintiles of a 'meat-dominated' dietary pattern (P= 0·001). Inflammatory biomarker concentrations decreased markedly across the quintiles of carotenoid component score (P< 0·001 for hs-CRP and IL-6, and P= 0·016 for E-selectin; ANCOVA). Prudent dietary pattern and carotenoid component scores were negatively associated with serum hs-CRP concentration (unstandardised β for prudent component: -0·053, 95% CI -0·102, -0·003; carotenoid component: -0·183, 95% CI -0·233, -0·134) independent of study covariates. A prudent dietary pattern (which reflects a diet high in the intakes of fish, yogurt, pulses, rice, pasta and wine, in addition to fruit and vegetable consumption) and a serum carotenoid profile characteristic of a fruit and vegetable-rich diet are associated with lower concentrations of intermediary markers that are indicative of CVD risk reduction."

False,reverse phase phosphoprotein array analysis revealed increased phosphorylation  serthr phosphosites indicating selective inhibition phosphatases calyculin calyculin treatment induced cell cycle arrest mdamb mcf breast cancer cellsnan,22069692,Calyculin A,breast cancer,"Cyclin D1 is a key regulator of the cell cycle that is over expressed in more than half of breast cancer patients. The levels of cyclin D1 are controlled primarily through post-translational mechanisms and phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at T286 induces its proteasomal degradation. To date, no studies have explored the involvement of phosphatases in this process. Here we treated human breast cancer cells with the structurally distinct toxins calyculin A, okadaic acid, and cantharidin, which are known to inhibit Ser/Thr phosphatases of the PPP family. At low nanomolar concentrations calyculin A induced T286 phosphorylation and degradation of cyclin D1 via the proteosome in MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Cyclin D1 degradation also was dose-dependently induced by okadaic acid and catharidin, implicating a negative regulatory role for type-2A phosphatases. These effects occurred without increasing phosphorylation of p70S6K, cyclin D3, or myosin light chain that were used as endogenous reporters of cellular PP2A and PP1 activity. A reverse phase phosphoprotein array analysis revealed increased phosphorylation of only 6 out of 33 Ser/Thr phosphosites, indicating selective inhibition of phosphatases by calyculin A. Calyculin A treatment induced cell cycle arrest in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that a specific pool of type-2A phosphatase is inhibited by calyculin A leading to the degradation of cyclin D1 in human breast cancer cells. The results highlight the utility of toxins as pharmacological probes and points to the T286 cyclin D1 phosphatase inhibited by calyculin A as a possible target for chemotherapy to treat triple negative breast cancer."

True,transdermal fentanyl administered cautiously patients preexisting conditions emphysema may predispose development hypoventilation nan,14583070,fentanyl,hypoventilation,"Transdermal fentanyl is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of chronic pain caused by malignancy and non-malignant conditions when administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Compared with oral opioids, the advantages of transdermal fentanyl include a lower incidence and impact of adverse effects (constipation, nausea and vomiting, and daytime drowsiness), a higher degree of patient satisfaction, improved quality of life, improved convenience and compliance resulting from administration every 72 hours, and decreased use of rescue medication. Transdermal fentanyl is a useful analgesic for cancer patients who are unable to swallow or have gastrointestinal problems. Transdermal fentanyl forms a depot within the upper skin layers before entering the microcirculation. Therapeutic blood levels are attained 12-16 hours after patch application and decrease slowly with a half-life of 16-22 hours following removal. Patients with chronic pain should be titrated to adequate relief with short-acting oral or parenteral opioids prior to the initiation of transdermal fentanyl in order to prevent exacerbations of pain or opioid-related adverse effects. Transdermal fentanyl can then be initiated based on the 24-hour opioid requirement once adequate analgesia has been achieved. The prolonged elimination of transdermal fentanyl can become problematic if patients develop opioid-related adverse effects, especially hypoventilation. Adverse effects do not improve immediately after patch removal and may take many hours to resolve. Patients who experience opioid-related toxicity associated with respiratory depression should be treated immediately with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone and closely monitored for at least 24 hours. Because of the short half-life of naloxone, sequential doses or a continuous infusion of the opioid antagonist may be necessary. Transdermal fentanyl should be administered cautiously to patients with pre-existing conditions such as emphysema that may predispose them to the development of hypoventilation. Transdermal fentanyl is indicated only for patients who require continuous opioid administration for the treatment of chronic pain that cannot be managed with other medications. It is contraindicated in the management of acute and postoperative pain, as pain may decrease more rapidly in these circumstances than fentanyl blood levels can be adjusted, leading to the development of life-threatening hypoventilation. Cognitive and physical impairments such as confusion and abnormal co-ordination can occur with transdermal fentanyl. Therefore, patients should be instructed to refrain from driving or operating machinery immediately following the initiation of transdermal fentanyl, or after any dosage increase. Patients may resume such activities once the absence of these potential adverse effects is documented."
False,refractory gcse continuous iv midazolam infusion mgkghr mgkg iv bolus effective advantages traditional therapies induces less hypotension cardiorespiratory depression easily titratednan,10516875,midazolam,cardiorespiratory depression,"Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is a medical emergency requiring prompt resolution. Acute treatment is often delayed by difficulty in obtaining intravenous (i.v.) access. Refractory GCSE is often difficult to treat, and traditional therapy with barbiturates induces hypotension and respiratory depression and prolongs recovery. Midazolam is particularly useful for treating acute GCSE because it has an imidazole ring that is open at low pH, allowing it to be dissolved in aqueous solution for intramuscular injection, but closed at physiologic pH, increasing lipophilicity and rendering good intramuscular absorption, brain penetration, and fast onset of action. When given intramuscularly as a 0.2 mg/kg bolus, it has efficacy at least equal to that of i.v. diazepam, is well tolerated, induces little respiratory compromise, and has a shorter latency to onset of action. Therefore, it should be considered for the treatment of acute GCSE when i.v. access is problematic. For refractory GCSE, continuous i.v. midazolam infusion at 0.1-0.6 mg/kg/hr after a 0.2 mg/kg i.v. bolus is effective and has advantages over traditional therapies because it induces less hypotension and cardiorespiratory depression and can be easily titrated. Further prospective studies are needed to define the role of continuous i.v. midazolam compared to other contemporary therapies."
True,determining patient preferences improved chemotoxicity treatment advanced bladder cancer conventional treatment advanced bladder cancer methotrexate vinblastine doxorubicin plus cisplatin mvac median survival year significant toxicity nan,15842461,doxorubicin,toxicity,"Determining patient preferences for improved chemotoxicity during treatment for advanced bladder cancer Conventional treatment for advanced bladder cancer is methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin plus cisplatin (MVAC), with a median survival of 1 year but significant toxicity. The newer combination of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) has demonstrated comparable survival and an improved toxicity profile (Von der Maase et al. 2000). At present, the importance to patients of the toxicity of chemotherapy has not been widely studied. An earlier study in bladder cancer indicated that toxicity was an important determinant of treatment preference (Davey et al. 2000). A study of preferences for advanced bladder cancer therapy in the UK was proposed."

False,results suggest pmdd women without history sexual abuse respond differently clonidine challenge measures reflecting autonomic nervous system functioning indicating abuse may modify presynaptic alphaar function pmddnan,15925031,clonidine,sexual abuse,"In women meeting strict criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), we examined whether clonidine, an alpha2-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist, would have different effects on sexually abused versus non-abused PMDD women for measures of autonomic nervous system function. Twelve women meeting prospective, DSM-IV criteria for PMDD, five of whom had a history of sexual abuse, participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design study, comparing 2 months of on oral clonidine (0.3 mg/day) with 2 months on active placebo. During the luteal phase that preceded randomization and following each two-month challenge, women were tested for cardiovascular measures at rest and in response to mental stress, and for resting plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations as well as beta1 and beta2-AR responsivity using the isoproterenol sensitivity test. Results revealed that in comparison to placebo, clonidine significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine concentrations, increased both beta1- and beta2-AR responsivity, and reduced resting and stress heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) (p < 0.05) in all PMDD women. With clonidine, sexually abused PMDD women exhibited greater decreases in resting and stress-induced HR (p < 0.01) and stress-induced systolic BP (p < 0.05), while non-abused PMDD women exhibited greater reductions in plasma NE concentration (p = 0.07), and greater increases in beta2-AR responsivity (p < 0.05) than abused PMDD women. These results suggest PMDD women with and without a history of sexual abuse respond differently to a clonidine challenge in measures reflecting autonomic nervous system functioning, indicating that abuse may modify presynaptic alpha2-AR function in PMDD."
True,results phase iiiii studies suggest zaleplon  mg produces dosedependent reduction sleep latency patients suffering primary insomnianan,11060714,zaleplon,reduction in sleep latency,"Zaleplon (N-[3-(3-cyanopyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidin-7-yl) phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide) is a non-benzodiazepine recently introduced for clinical use. This agent is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Preclinical studies have shown that the benzodiazepines triazolam and Ro17-1812 can substitute for zaleplon in animals trained to distinguish zaleplon from saline. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can antagonise the discriminative stimulus effect of zaleplon. These findings suggest that zaleplon is recognised by animals as a benzodiazepine agent. Zaleplon is active after ip. and oral administration in a variety of motor performance tests, including locomotor activity, rotarod and the loaded grid. Zaleplon has been shown to be active in a number of different anticonvulsant models, including the pentylenetetrazole, isoniazid and electroshock models. The compound is also reported to be active against convulsions induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin and strychnine. Studies in anxiolytic models suggest that zaleplon may have weak anxiolytic activity. From preclinical studies, it appears zaleplon possesses a reduced risk of tolerance compared to triazolam, is less likely to potentiate the effects of ethanol and is unlikely to produce amnestic effects. In man, zaleplon is rapidly absorbed and undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism. The compound has a plasma half-life of approximately one hour and is metabolised primarily via the aldehyde oxidase system to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. This metabolite, along with other minor metabolites formed in vivo, do not appear to contribute to the activity of zaleplon. Metabolites of zaleplon are excreted primarily via the urine. Phase I studies suggest that single daytime doses of zaleplon up to 15 mg are well-tolerated. Short-term impairment of performance occurs when zaleplon is administered during the day at doses epsilon 20 mg. However, given the short half-life of the compound, significant impairment of daytime performance is unlikely if zaleplon is administered at bedtime or shortly after retiring for the evening. Results from Phase II/III studies suggest that zaleplon (5 - 20 mg) produces a dose-dependent reduction in sleep latency in patients suffering from primary insomnia. The clinical efficacy of zaleplon persists for at least four weeks at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. Studies in patients with a history of drug abuse suggest that the abuse potential of zaleplon (at doses above the therapeutic dose range) is similar to that seen with the benzodiazepine triazolam."

False,clinical trials lower blood glucose disappointing probably participants late natural history diabetes already extensive vascular diseasenan,22399368,glucose,blood glucose,"Excess total and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain very high among those with type 2 diabetes versus those without diabetes. Clinical trials to lower blood glucose have been disappointing probably because the participants were too late in the natural history of diabetes and already had extensive vascular disease. Insulin resistance measured simply by elevated fasting blood insulin is an early marker of β-cell stress and peripheral insulin resistance. Metformin will prevent development of diabetes among patients with impaired fasting glucose but only for the short term. Metformin reduces risk of coronary heart disease. The drug is safe, low cost, and may also prevent cancer. The combination of diet and exercise followed by metformin in the early phase of ""insulin resistance"" may reduce or delay both atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis complications associated with diabetes. Preventive therapy must begin much earlier than before clinical diagnosis of diabetes and aim to initially lower blood insulin levels or insulin resistance."
True,effect calcium chloride injected cerebral ventricles grouphoused unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization rage hissing snarling fighting attack paws claws defense paws claws biting mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsions produced carbachol eserine injected similarly investigatednan,6892185,carbachol,tremor,"The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."

In the present work, extracts of 12 selected herbs were prepared with methanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate and water, and the effects of these on the multidrug resistance (MDR) and P-glycoprotein of mouse lymphoma cells transfected with the human mdr1 gene and on a human lung alveolar epithelial cell line were investigated. The extracts were tested for antiproliferative effects, and the reversal of MDR in mouse lymphoma cells. The possible chemopreventive effect of the chloroform extracts was studied on the expression of cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early (IE) antigen in human lung cancer cells (A549). The antimicrobial effects of the extracts were tested on some representative micro-organisms. Certain of the chloroform extracts of the plant materials were the most effective compounds on the reversal of MDR. Two of the chloroform extracts enhanced the antiproliferative effect of doxorubicin on MDR mouse lymphoma cells. The selected extracts did not show any antibacterial effect with the agar diffusion method. Certain chloroform extracts decreased the intermediate IE antigen expression of CMV in A459 cells."

True,cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis associated oxacillin nan,11337188,oxacillin,Cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis,"A 67-year-old man who was treated with oxacillin for one week because of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, developed renal failure and diffuse, symmetric, palpable purpuric lesions on his feet. Necrotic blisters were noted on his fingers. Skin biopsies showed findings diagnostic of leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Oxacillin was discontinued and patient was treated with corticosteroids. The rash disappeared after three weeks and renal function returned to normal. Leucocytoclastic vasculitis presents as palpable purpura of the lower extremities often accompanied by abdominal pain, arthralgia, and renal involvement. Etiologic factors or associated disorders include infections, medications, collagen vascular disease and neoplasia. However, in half of the cases no etiologic factor is identified. Usually it is a self-limited disorder, but corticosteroid therapy may be needed in life-threatening cases since early treatment with corticosteroids in severe cases can prevent complications. Oxacillin should be included among the drugs that can cause leucocytoclastic vasculitis."
True,ammonia coma produced rats within  minutes intraperitonealinjection mmol nh4cl nan,761833,NH4CL,coma,"Ammonia coma was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1.7 mmol NH4CL. This coma was prevented with 1.68 mmol L-dopa given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the ammonium salt injection. The effect of L-dopa was correlated with a decrease in blood and brain ammonia, an increase in brain dopamine, and an increase in renal excretion of ammonia and urea. Intraventricular infusion of dopamine sufficient to raise the brain dopamine to the same extent did not prevent the ammonia coma nor affect the blood and brain ammonia concentrations. Bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of L-dopa on blood and brain ammonia and the ammonia coma was not prevented. Thus, the reduction in blood and brain ammonia and the prevention of ammonia coma after L-dopa, can be accounted for by the peripheral effect of dopamine on renal function rather than its central action. These results provide a reasonable explanation for the beneficial effects observed in some encephalopathic patients receiving L-dopa."
True,environmental impact associated resource depletion human toxicity mainly associated cobalt copper nickel thallium silver whereas ecotoxicity potential primarily associated cobalt copper nickel thallium silvernan,23638841,cobalt,toxicity,"Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-polymer (Li-poly) batteries have recently become dominant in consumer electronic products because of advantages associated with energy density and product longevity. However, the small size of these batteries, the high rate of disposal of consumer products in which they are used, and the lack of uniform regulatory policy on their disposal means that lithium batteries may contribute substantially to environmental pollution and adverse human health impacts due to potentially toxic materials. In this research, we used standardized leaching tests, life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and hazard assessment models to evaluate hazardous waste classification, resource depletion potential, and toxicity potentials of lithium batteries used in cellphones. Our results demonstrate that according to U.S. federal regulations, defunct Li-ion batteries are classified hazardous due to their lead (Pb) content (average 6.29 mg/L; σ = 11.1; limit 5). However, according to California regulations, all lithium batteries tested are classified hazardous due to excessive levels of cobalt (average 163,544 mg/kg; σ = 62,897; limit 8000), copper (average 98,694 mg/kg; σ = 28,734; limit 2500), and nickel (average 9525 mg/kg; σ = 11,438; limit 2000). In some of the Li-ion batteries, the leached concentrations of chromium, lead, and thallium exceeded the California regulation limits. The environmental impact associated with resource depletion and human toxicity is mainly associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver, whereas the ecotoxicity potential is primarily associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver. However, the relative contribution of aluminum and lithium to human toxicity and ecotoxicity could not be estimated due to insufficient toxicity data in the models. These findings support the need for stronger government policy at the local, national, and international levels to encourage recovery, recycling, and reuse of lithium battery materials."
False,pooled data trials comparing antithrombotic treatment placebo shown warfarin reduces risk stroke aspirin alone reduces risk nan,17020434,aspirin,stroke,"Atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62%, and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22%. Overall, in high-risk patients, warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes, with a relative risk reduction of 36%. Ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was found to be as efficient as vitamin K antagonist drugs in the prevention of embolic events, but has been recently withdrawn because of abnormal liver function tests. The ACTIVE-W (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) in the prevention af embolic events. Idraparinux, a Factor Xa inhibitor, is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor-blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac remodelling. Preliminary studies suggest that statins could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion. Finally, percutaneous methods for the exclusion of left atrial appendage are under investigation in high-risk patients."

True,setting imidsbased treatments associated rates vte reaching values  particularly dexamethasone chemotherapy addednan,21455855,dexamethasone,VTE,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease with a high prevalence in elderly people, affecting > 5% of the population > 65 years of age. Cancer patients have a 4.3-fold higher incidence of thrombotic complications, due to multiple risk factors that are not always related to the disease. Among hematologic malignancies, multiple myeloma (MM) confers a high risk of developing such complications, with a VTE rate of nearly 10%. Multiple factors are involved in MM-related VTE, such as increased blood viscosity, high levels of immunoglobulin, procoagulant activity of monoclonal protein, and inflammatory cytokines. Since the introduction of the immunomodulatory derivatives (IMiDs) thalidomide and lenalidomide in the therapeutic armamentarium of MM, VTE has emerged as one of the leading complications, in particular in patients with newly diagnosed MM. In this setting, IMiDs-based treatments are associated with rates of VTE reaching values up to 14 to 26%, particularly when dexamethasone or chemotherapy are added. The optimal prophylaxis for patients receiving these antiangiogenetic agents is still a matter of debate. Due to the lack of prospective randomized clinical trials, different studies have used various anticoagulant prophylaxes, including fixed low-dose warfarin (1 mg or 1.25 mg), therapeutic doses of warfarin (international normalized ratio between 2.0 and 3.0), low molecular weight heparin, or low-dose aspirin. As yet, no study has clearly demonstrated a significant superiority of one prophylactic regimen in comparison with the others. Further investigation and more randomized clinical trials are needed to define the best thromboprophylaxis."

False,blockade reninangiotensin aldosterone system proven effective retarding progression renal disease remnant kidney model well experimental diseases importantly range progressive human renal diseasesnan,11709805,aldosterone,renal disease,"Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has proven effective in retarding progression of renal disease in the remnant kidney model, as well as other experimental diseases, and, most importantly, in a range of progressive human renal diseases. Attention has focused on the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in propagating progression both by its hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic actions. Recent evidence, predominately in the remnant kidney model, indicates that the drugs used to block this hormone system, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, also lower aldosterone levels. Thus, aldosterone, as well as angiotensin II, appears to be instrumental in sustaining the hypertension and fibroproliferative destruction of the residual kidney."

Twelve women meeting prospective, DSM-IV criteria for PMDD, five of whom had a history of sexual abuse, participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design study, comparing 2 months of on oral clonidine (0.3 mg/day) with 2 months on active placebo. During the luteal phase that preceded randomization and following each two-month challenge, women were tested for cardiovascular measures at rest and in response to mental stress, and for resting plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations as well as beta1 and beta2-AR responsivity using the isoproterenol sensitivity test. Results revealed that in comparison to placebo, clonidine significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine concentrations, increased both beta1- and beta2-AR responsivity, and reduced resting and stress heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) (p < 0.05) in all PMDD women. With clonidine, sexually abused PMDD women exhibited greater decreases in resting and stress-induced HR (p < 0.01) and stress-induced systolic BP (p < 0.05), while non-abused PMDD women exhibited greater reductions in plasma NE concentration (p = 0.07), and greater increases in beta2-AR responsivity (p < 0.05) than abused PMDD women. These results suggest PMDD women with and without a history of sexual abuse respond differently to a clonidine challenge in measures reflecting autonomic nervous system functioning, indicating that abuse may modify presynaptic alpha2-AR function in PMDD."

True,include forced hyperventilation paco barbiturate coma experimental protocols tris buffer indomethacin induced hypothermianan,18286835,barbiturate,coma,"Intracranial pressure (ICP) is the pressure exerted by cranial contents on the dural envelope. It comprises the partial pressures of brain, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Normal intracranial pressure is somewhere below 10 mmHg; it may increase as a result of traumatic brain injury, stroke, neoplasm, Reye's syndrome, hepatic coma, or other pathologies. When ICP increases above 20 mmHg it may damage neurons and jeopardize cerebral perfusion. If such a condition persists, treatment is indicated. Control of ICP requires measurement, which can only be performed invasively. Standard techniques include direct ventricular manometry or measurement in the parenchyma with electronic or fiberoptic devices. Displaying the time course of pressure (high-resolution ICP tonoscopy) allows assessment of the validity of the signal and identification of specific pathological findings, such as A-, B- and C-waves. When ICP is pathologically elevated--at or above 20-25 mmHg--it needs to be lowered. A range of treatment modalities is available and should be applied with consideration of the underlying cause. When intracranial hypertension is caused by hematoma, contusion, tumor, hygroma, hydrocephalus or pneumatocephalus, surgical treatment is indicated. In the absence of a surgically treatable condition, ICP may be controlled by correcting the patient's position, temperature, ventilation or hemodynamics. If intracranial hypertension persists, drainage of CSF via external drainage is most effective. Other first-tier options include induced hypocapnea (hyperventilation; paCO2 < 35 mmHg), hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol, hypertonic saline) and induced arterial hypertension (CPP concept). When autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is compromised, hyperoncotic treatment aimed at reducing vasogenic edema and intracranial blood volume may be applied. When intracranial hypertension persists, second-tier treatments may be indicated. These include 'forced hyperventilation' (paCO2 < 25 mmHg), barbiturate coma or experimental protocols such as tris buffer, indomethacin or induced hypothermia. The last resort is emergent bilateral decompressive craniectomy; once taken into consideration, it should be performed without undue delay."

True,additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness nausea ie nicotine increases sensitivity motion sicknessnan,17990061,nicotine,nausea,"Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."
True,however iontophoresis noradrenaline thermal hyperalgesia greater guanethidinepretreated site saline pretreated sitenan,11474550,noradrenaline,thermal hyperalgesia,"Supersensitivity to noradrenaline contributes to certain vascular disorders (e.g., hypertension) and chronic neuropathic pain conditions (e.g., complex regional pain syndrome). We aimed to develop a procedure for inducing adrenergic supersensitivity that could be used to investigate the role of catecholamines in these clinical conditions. In the first study, three doses of guanethidine were administered by iontophoresis to separate small patches of skin in the forearm of healthy human volunteers. Four to five hours later. the vasoconstrictor response to the adrenergic releasing agent tyramine was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by iontophoretic pretreatment with guanethidine, indicating that guanethidine had depleted endogenous adrenergic stores. In a second study, guanethidine and saline were administered by iontophoresis four times over approximately 2 weeks at separate sites in the forearm. One to two days after the final pretreatment, vasoconstriction to the iontophoresis of a weak dose of noradrenaline was enhanced at sites pretreated with guanethidine. To investigate the effect of guanethidine pretreatment on thermal hyperalgesia. the experimental sites were sensitized to heat by the topical application of 0.6% capsaicin. Both before and after the application of capsaicin, the heat-pain threshold and heat-pain ratings to suprathreshold stimulation were similar at sites pretreated for 2 weeks with guanethidine or saline. However, after the iontophoresis of noradrenaline, thermal hyperalgesia was greater at the guanethidine-pretreated site than the saline pretreated site. These observations indicate that prolonged depletion of adrenergic stores by guanethidine induces adrenergic supersensitivity in cutaneous vessels, and that adrenergic supersensitivity enhances thermal hyperalgesia in the presence of noradrenaline."

Prolongation of QT interval, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents, but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem, an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for hypertension. The patient was in near syncope and had QT-interval prolongation. After discontinuing cisapride, the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur. We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, including diltiazem."

False,eight single nucleotide polymorphisms snps slca genotyped aspirin intolerant asthma aia aspirin tolerant asthma ata patients korean ethnicitynan,20597903,aspirin,aspirin-tolerant asthma/ATA,"Aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) occurs from asthma exacerbation after exposure to aspirin. However, the underlying mechanisms of AIA occurrence are still unclear. The critical role of the solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, betaine/GABA) member 12 (SLC6A12) gene in GABAergic transmission, which is associated with mucus production in asthma, makes it a candidate gene for AIA association study. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLC6A12 were genotyped in 163 aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) and 429 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) patients of Korean ethnicity. Associations between polymorphisms of SLC6A12 and AIA were analysed using multivariate logistic analysis. Results showed that two polymorphisms and a haplotype in SLC6A12, rs499368 (P= 0.005; P(corr)= 0.03), rs557881 (non-synonymous C10R, P= 0.007; P(corr)= 0.04), and SLC6A12_BL1_ht1 (P= 0.009; P(corr)= 0.05) respectively, were significantly associated with AIA after multiple testing corrections. In addition, SNPs of SLC6A12 were significantly associated with the fall rate of FEV(1) by aspirin provocation suggesting that SLC6A12 could affect reversibility of lung function abnormalities in AIA patients. Although these results are preliminary and future replications are needed to confirm these findings, this study showed evidence of association between variants in SLC6A12 and AIA occurrence among asthmatics in a Korean population."
False,previously demonstrated polynitric oxide conjugated human serum albumin poly-sno-hsa potential dds carrier capable accumulating tumors nan,24846171,Poly-SNO-HSA,tumors,"Macromolecules have been developed as carriers of low-molecular-weight drugs in drug delivery systems (DDS) to improve their pharmacokinetic profile or to promote their uptake in tumor tissue via enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects. We have previously demonstrated that poly-nitric oxide (NO) conjugated human serum albumin (Poly-SNO-HSA) has the potential to be a DDS carrier capable of accumulating NO in tumors. However, the stability of Poly-SNO-HSA in the circulation has to be improved, and its optimal molecular size for using the EPR effects has to be evaluated. In the present study, we performed two tuning methods for refining Poly-SNO-HSA, namely, pegylation and dimerization. We observed that pegylation enhanced the stability of Poly-SNO-HSA both in vitro and in vivo, and that dimerization of Poly-SNO-HSA enhanced the antitumor activity via more efficient delivery of NO in Colon 26 tumor-bearing mice. Intriguingly, dimerization resulted in a 10 times higher antitumor activity. These data suggest that pegylation and dimerization of Poly-SNO-HSA are very important tuners to optimize NO stability and accumulation, and thereby effect, in tumors. Thus, polyethylene glycol-Poly-SNO-HSA dimer seems to be a very appealing and safe NO carrier and thereby a strong candidate as an antitumor drug in future development of cancer therapeutics."

BK virus (BKV) has been commonly found to be associated with hematuria in stem cell transplant patients; however, it has rarely been reported after cyclophosphamide chemotherapy alone. The authors present 3 cases of BK viruria with HC in nontransplant pediatric oncology patients. The 3 patients with BKV had more prolonged hematuria (14 to 16 wk) compared with 1 patient with BKV-negative HC (10 wk). The HC necessitated chemotherapy delays and also prolonged supportive care. One patient was treated with intravenous cidofovir with resolution of BK viruria and hematuria. BKV may have an association with the development of HC in nonstem cell transplant patients receiving high-dose oxazophosphorine chemotherapy. HC may present early and be more prolonged in patients with BK viruria. Patients with HC after cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide with negative bacterial cultures should be studied for BKV. Cidofovir may be beneficial in certain patients with BK viruria and HC; however, definitive data will require a clinical trial."

Of 2959 blood recipients between January 1982 and December 1988, 504 (22.5%) developed posttransfusion hepatitis, with a mean transfusion volume of 10.2 units. Of the 504 cases of posttransfusion hepatitis, ""icteric"" (T-Bil > 2.0 mg/dl) and ""overt icteric"" hepatitis (T-Bil > 5.0 mg-dl) developed in 111 cases (22.0%) and 28 cases (5.6%), respectively.

False,twentyone consecutive cancer patients morphineinduced delirium underwent opioid rotation fentanyl nan,16043013,fentanyl,delirium,"Although recent studies suggest that opioid rotation could be an effective treatment strategy for morphine-induced delirium, there have been no prospective studies to investigate the treatment effects of opioid rotation using fentanyl. The primary aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in symptom palliation of morphine-induced delirium. Twenty-one consecutive cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium underwent opioid rotation to fentanyl. Physicians recorded the symptom severity of delirium (the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, MDAS), pain, and other symptoms (categorical verbal scale from 0: none to 3: severe) and the Schedule for Team Assessment Scale (STAS) (from 0: none to 4: extreme); and performance status at the time of study enrollment and three and seven days after. Of 21 patients recruited, one patient did not complete the study. In the remaining 20 patients, morphine was substituted with transdermal fentanyl in 9 patients and parenteral fentanyl in 11 patients. Total opioid dose increased from 64 mg oral morphine equivalent/day (Day 0) to 98 mg/day (Day 7), and the median increase in total opioid dose was 42%. Treatment success, defined as an MDAS score below 10 and pain score of 2 or less, was obtained in 13 patients on Day 3 and 18 patients on Day 7. The mean MDAS score significantly decreased from 14 (Day 0) to 6.4 and 3.6 (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Pain scores significantly decreased from 2.2 (Day 0) to 1.3 and 1.1 on the categorical verbal scale (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001); from 2.6 (Day 0) to 1.6 and 1.3 on the STAS (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Symptom scores of dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting significantly decreased, and performance status significantly improved. Opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl may be effective in alleviating delirium and pain in cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium."

In idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) the vasodilating vasoactive intestinal peptide (aviptadil) is deficient. The aim of the present study was to test the acute effects on haemodynamics and blood gases, and the safety, of a single dose of inhaled aviptadil in chronic PH. A total of 20 patients with PH (PAH in nine, PH in lung disease in eight and chronic thromboembolic PH in three) inhaled a single 100-microg dose of aviptadil during right-heart catheterisation. Haemodynamics and blood gases were measured. Aviptadil aerosol caused a small and temporary but significant selective pulmonary vasodilation, an improved stroke volume and mixed venous oxygen saturation. Overall, six patients experienced a pulmonary vascular resistance reduction of >20%. In patients with significant lung disease, aviptadil tended to improve oxygenation. The pulmonary vasodilating effect of aviptadil aerosol was modest and short-lived, did not cause any side-effects and led to a reduced workload of the right ventricle without affecting systemic blood pressure. Aviptadil inhalation tended to improve oxygenation in patients with significant lung disease. Further studies are needed to evaluate the full therapeutic potential of aviptadil aerosol, including higher doses and chronic treatment."

Chronic pulmonary sequelae in response to silicone injection have not been previously described. We report a case of chronic progressive granulomatous pneumonitis in response to subcutaneous silicone injections in a transgender male-to-female patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). After receiving silicone injections to the buttock, the patient developed rapid onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and chills. Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse peripheral interstitial opacities. She responded symptomatically to prednisone with subsequent intermittent symptomatic flares. Four years later, she developed marked dyspnea and cough. Chest computed tomography showed progressive diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities. Lung biopsies demonstrated numerous spheroid silicone particles within the lung interstitium and small pulmonary vessels, surrounded by foreign body giant cells and nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation. We speculate that HIV-1-infected patients may be at risk for chronic, progressive granulomatous pneumonitis due to silicone injection years after their procedure owing to shifting levels of cell-mediated immunity."

It has been reported that c-Cbl and Cbl-b mRNAs are up-regulated during TPA-induced U937 and HL-60 cell differentiation. But the mechanism of the up-regulation and the roles of the Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases still remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that bufalin enhanced all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, accompanied by up-regulation of the Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases. CsA, an inhibitor of calcium mobilization, reversed this up-regulation. Pretreatment with CsA and PS-341 did not affect the expression of CD11b, but suppressed the percentage of adherent cells. Lipid raft localization of Cbl-b enhanced cell adhesion, while C-terminal deletion partially suppressed the effect. Moreover, the expression of the adhesion-related kinases Pyk2 and Paxillin was up-regulated in parallel with the increase of Cbl proteins. These results suggested that up-regulation of c-Cbl and Cbl-b was involved in the regulation of ATRA and bufalin-induced HL-60 cell adhesion rather than cell differentiation, which might be mediated by lipid raft localization, ubiquitin ligase activity and C-terminal structure of Cbl proteins. Meanwhile, up-regulation of proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) and Paxillin might also be implicated in this regulation."

False,zaleplon review novel sedative hypnotic used treatment insomnia nan,11060714,Zaleplon,insomnia,"Zaleplon (N-[3-(3-cyanopyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidin-7-yl) phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide) is a non-benzodiazepine recently introduced for clinical use. This agent is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Preclinical studies have shown that the benzodiazepines triazolam and Ro17-1812 can substitute for zaleplon in animals trained to distinguish zaleplon from saline. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can antagonise the discriminative stimulus effect of zaleplon. These findings suggest that zaleplon is recognised by animals as a benzodiazepine agent. Zaleplon is active after ip. and oral administration in a variety of motor performance tests, including locomotor activity, rotarod and the loaded grid. Zaleplon has been shown to be active in a number of different anticonvulsant models, including the pentylenetetrazole, isoniazid and electroshock models. The compound is also reported to be active against convulsions induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin and strychnine. Studies in anxiolytic models suggest that zaleplon may have weak anxiolytic activity. From preclinical studies, it appears zaleplon possesses a reduced risk of tolerance compared to triazolam, is less likely to potentiate the effects of ethanol and is unlikely to produce amnestic effects. In man, zaleplon is rapidly absorbed and undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism. The compound has a plasma half-life of approximately one hour and is metabolised primarily via the aldehyde oxidase system to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. This metabolite, along with other minor metabolites formed in vivo, do not appear to contribute to the activity of zaleplon. Metabolites of zaleplon are excreted primarily via the urine. Phase I studies suggest that single daytime doses of zaleplon up to 15 mg are well-tolerated. Short-term impairment of performance occurs when zaleplon is administered during the day at doses epsilon 20 mg. However, given the short half-life of the compound, significant impairment of daytime performance is unlikely if zaleplon is administered at bedtime or shortly after retiring for the evening. Results from Phase II/III studies suggest that zaleplon (5 - 20 mg) produces a dose-dependent reduction in sleep latency in patients suffering from primary insomnia. The clinical efficacy of zaleplon persists for at least four weeks at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. Studies in patients with a history of drug abuse suggest that the abuse potential of zaleplon (at doses above the therapeutic dose range) is similar to that seen with the benzodiazepine triazolam."

Antirheumatic drugs, methotrexate, leflunomide (LEF), infliximab and etanercept, were known as risk factors for developing rheumatoid nodule. However, there was no case report of rheumatoid nodule-associated pneumothorax with the use of LEF. We report, first, herein a case of 46-year-old woman with RA who suffered recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax associated with multiple bilateral subpleural cavitary nodules during treatment with LEF. We reviewed the cases of LEF-related pulmonary nodules developed in patients with RA. Thus, we suggested that pneumothorax can be a rare respiratory fatal complication in patients with RA with pulmonary nodules and LEF can be a rare cause of these manifestations."

True,except one hyperthermia victims influence ethanol nan,2279717,ethanol,hyperthermia,"A group of five hyperthermia-related deaths is presented in which urinary noradrenaline (NA) concentrations were elevated (172.1 +/- 119.4 ng/ml) compared with a control group of rapid violent deaths (43.7 +/- 26.1 ng/ml). Urinary adrenaline (A) concentrations were not elevated in the hyperthermia cases, nor were there any significant differences in urinary dopamine (DA) concentrations between the two groups. All except one of the hyperthermia victims were under the influence of ethanol. It is suggested that a combination of heat stress and ethanol consumption was responsible for the elevated urinary NA in the hyperthermia cases, reflecting increased sympathetic nervous system activity. A combination of high urinary NA with low A seems to be characteristic of hyperthermia fatalities, in contrast to hypothermia deaths, where both NA and A are usually elevated."

The study aimed at identifying factors responsible for iron deficiency. Twenty-six percent of athletes and 50% of controls had latent iron-deficiency without anemia symptoms. A too low intake of iron (especially heme iron: 0.3 mg daily), and of nutrients influencing iron metabolism, were identified as main causes of iron deficiency in control subjects. In athletes, whose iron intake was sufficient (14.6 mg), the principal cause of iron deficiency were blood losses due to menstruation. High level of physical activity, expressed as training volume and experience, did not adversely affect iron stores, as these were higher than in control subjects and the incidence of iron deficiency was much lower than in the control group. It was concluded that an increased intake of iron and of dietary factors involved in iron metabolism prevented possible exercise-induced losses of iron in young athletes."
True,research used standardized leaching tests lifecycle impact assessment lcia hazard assessment models evaluate hazardous waste classification resource depletion potential toxicity potentials lithium batteries used cellphonesnan,23638841,lithium,toxicity,"Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-polymer (Li-poly) batteries have recently become dominant in consumer electronic products because of advantages associated with energy density and product longevity. However, the small size of these batteries, the high rate of disposal of consumer products in which they are used, and the lack of uniform regulatory policy on their disposal means that lithium batteries may contribute substantially to environmental pollution and adverse human health impacts due to potentially toxic materials. In this research, we used standardized leaching tests, life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and hazard assessment models to evaluate hazardous waste classification, resource depletion potential, and toxicity potentials of lithium batteries used in cellphones. Our results demonstrate that according to U.S. federal regulations, defunct Li-ion batteries are classified hazardous due to their lead (Pb) content (average 6.29 mg/L; σ = 11.1; limit 5). However, according to California regulations, all lithium batteries tested are classified hazardous due to excessive levels of cobalt (average 163,544 mg/kg; σ = 62,897; limit 8000), copper (average 98,694 mg/kg; σ = 28,734; limit 2500), and nickel (average 9525 mg/kg; σ = 11,438; limit 2000). In some of the Li-ion batteries, the leached concentrations of chromium, lead, and thallium exceeded the California regulation limits. The environmental impact associated with resource depletion and human toxicity is mainly associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver, whereas the ecotoxicity potential is primarily associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver. However, the relative contribution of aluminum and lithium to human toxicity and ecotoxicity could not be estimated due to insufficient toxicity data in the models. These findings support the need for stronger government policy at the local, national, and international levels to encourage recovery, recycling, and reuse of lithium battery materials."
False,comparative study coumadin aspirin primary cardioembolic stroke thromboembolic preventions chronic rheumatic mitral stenosis atrial fibrillation nan,7798824,coumadin,atrial fibrillation,"The comparative study of the efficacy of coumadin and aspirin in primary cardioembolic stroke prevention of chronic rheumatic heart disease (mitral stenosis) with atrial fibrillation was conducted at Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the trial. Allocation of patients into coumadin or aspirin groups depended upon the patients' choice. Nineteen patients were given coumadin at the adjusted dosage to maintain the therapeutic range of International Normalised Ratio between 1.5-3. Sixty patients were given aspirin at the fixed dosage of 75 mg per day. Six patients were lost to follow-up over the 3 yr period; four in the aspirin group and 2 in the coumadin group. There were three patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke in the aspirin group but none in the coumadin group after three years of follow-up. Six patients had mitral valve replacement during the study (i.e. three patients in each group). There were complications in 12 patients, 10 in the aspirin (16.6 per cent) and 2 in the coumadin (10.5 per cent) group. The complications in coumadin group were minor bleeding over the thigh in one patient and generalised ecchymosis over the whole body in one other. In the aspirin group, the complication was gastrointestional symptoms, mainly epigastric pain, but no frank bleeding was observed. Primary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in chronic rheumatic heart disease was found to be more effective with coumadin than aspirin. Our study does not support the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiac embolism in chronic rheumatic heart disease."
False,contrast anaesthetised dogs differences seen incidence spontaneous electrical stimulation induced ventricular tachycardia fibrillations among animals exposed levobupivacaine bupivacaine nan,11945112,bupivacaine,fibrillations,"Bupivacaine is currently the most widely used long-acting local anaesthetic. Its uses include surgery and obstetrics; however, it has been associated with potentially fatal cardiotoxicity, particularly when given intravascularly by accident. Levobupivacaine, a single enantiomer of bupivacaine, has recently been introduced as a new long-acting local anaesthetic with a potentially reduced toxicity compared with bupivacaine. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have compared levobupivacaine with bupivacaine and in most but not all studies there is evidence that levobupivacaine is less toxic. Advantages for levobupivacaine are seen on cardiac sodium and potassium channels, on isolated animal hearts and in whole animals, anaesthetised or awake. In particular the intravascular dose of levobupivacaine required to cause lethality in animals is consistently higher compared with bupivacaine. In awake sheep, for example, almost 78% more levobupivacaine was required to cause death. In contrast, in anaesthetised dogs no differences were seen in the incidence of spontaneous or electrical stimulation- induced ventricular tachycardia and fibrillations among animals exposed to levobupivacaine or bupivacaine. The reversibility of levobupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity has also been assessed. Some data point to an advantage of levobupivacaine over bupivacaine but this potential advantage was not confirmed in a recent study in anaesthetised dogs. Three clinical studies have been conducted using surrogate markers of both cardiac and CNS toxicity. In these studies levobupivacaine or bupivacaine were given by intravascular injection to healthy volunteers. Levobupivacaine was found to cause smaller changes in indices of cardiac contractility and the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and also to have less depressant effect on the electroencephalogram. Assuming that levobupivacaine has the same local anaesthetic potency as bupivacaine, then, all things being equal, it is difficult to argue that levobupivacaine should not displace bupivacaine as the long-acting local anaesthetic of choice. It would appear, however, that levobupivacaine has not yet significantly displaced bupivacaine from the markets in which it is sold. This may be due to a lack of perceived safety benefit and/or consideration of the additional costs that are associated with switching to levobupivacaine, which is approximately 57% more expensive than bupivacaine. If the price of levobupivacaine were closer to bupivacaine then the argument to switch to levobupivacaine would undoubtedly be much stronger. With the continued clinical use of levobupivacaine the database available to make comparisons will increase and this may allow cost-benefit arguments to be made more forcefully for levobupivacaine in the future."
True,antirheumatic drugs methotrexate leflunomide lef infliximab etanercept known risk factors developing rheumatoid nodule nan,19862529,methotrexate,rheumatoid nodule,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multisystem inflammatory disease characterized by destructive synovitis and systemic extraarticular involvement. One of the most common pulmonary manifestations of RA is rheumatoid nodule. Spontaneous pneumothorax also very rare pulmonary finding and could be associated with pulmonary nodules. Antirheumatic drugs, methotrexate, leflunomide (LEF), infliximab and etanercept, were known as risk factors for developing rheumatoid nodule. However, there was no case report of rheumatoid nodule-associated pneumothorax with the use of LEF. We report, first, herein a case of 46-year-old woman with RA who suffered recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax associated with multiple bilateral subpleural cavitary nodules during treatment with LEF. We reviewed the cases of LEF-related pulmonary nodules developed in patients with RA. Thus, we suggested that pneumothorax can be a rare respiratory fatal complication in patients with RA with pulmonary nodules and LEF can be a rare cause of these manifestations."

True,bodyweight gain common adverse effect although somewhat less reported olanzapine nan,11772153,olanzapine,Bodyweight gain,"Antipsychotics are frequently used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Atypical antipsychotics have come to the forefront in child psychiatry due largely to their tolerability profiles as well as their efficacy. Potential treatment options include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. A number of studies investigating the use of clozapine have been published in children; however, owing to the frequent monitoring required for agranulocytosis, the use of clozapine may be restricted to patients with treatment-refractory disease. With accumulating data on the development of glucose intolerance in adults receiving clozapine, closer monitoring of bodyweight and fasting blood glucose is imperative. Clozapine also has an increased seizure risk, therefore a baseline electroencephalogram should be performed, as well as continued vigilance for this adverse effect. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that is generally well tolerated and numerous studies have been published investigating this drug in children. Unlike clozapine, its receptor interaction profile lends itself toward increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinaemia. Bodyweight gain is a common adverse effect, although somewhat less than that reported with olanzapine. Baseline liver function studies prior to initiation of this medication are recommended. Risperidone-induced mania has been reported in adults and, therefore, increased caution should be used when deciding to treat children and adolescents with risperidone, particularly in those with a predisposition toward mania. Olanzapine, like risperidone, has also been associated with onset of mania in adults. Olanzapine has a receptor profile that results in significant risk for bodyweight gain and sedation. Furthermore, this drug has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance; thus, it is important to monitor bodyweight and fasting blood glucose on a frequent basis. Less information is known about quetiapine in children and adolescents. Reports about its efficacy and tolerability vary. Quetiapine appears to have increased risk for sedation and bodyweight gain, albeit less than that of olanzapine. The compound appears to be less likely to induce EPS. Finally, ziprasidone has recently been approved for use in the adult population. This compound, in terms of its receptor profile, has more in common with risperidone. This suggests a potential for increased risk of EPS and hyperprolactinaemia. It also has an increased risk of QTc prolongation; thus, a baseline electrocardiogram is suggested, particularly in those patients with a history of cardiovascular illness. Lack of evidence for bodyweight gain with ziprasidone is a considerable advantage."
False,despite tachycardia sympathetic activation snp phentolamine lf variability rr msna bp increased snp decreased phentolamine snp rr  msna  systolic bp  diastolic bp  phentolamine rr  msna  systolic bp  diastolic bp  nan,11454557,phentolamine,tachycardia,"The relative contributions of a central neural oscillator and of the delay in alpha-adrenergic transmission within the baroreflex loop in the predominance of low-frequency (LF) cardiovascular variability during sympathetic activation in humans are unclear. We measured R-R interval (RR), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), blood pressure (BP), and their variability in 10 normal subjects during sympathetic activation achieved by BP lowering with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and alpha-adrenergic blockade using phentolamine. SNP and phentolamine induced comparable reductions in BP (P > 0.25). Despite tachycardia and sympathetic activation with both SNP and phentolamine, LF variability in RR, MSNA, and BP increased during SNP and decreased during phentolamine (SNP: RR +20 +/- 6%, MSNA +3 +/- 5%, systolic BP +9 +/- 6%, diastolic BP +7 +/- 5%; phentolamine: RR -2 +/- 7%, MSNA -34 +/- 6%, systolic BP -16 +/- 8%, diastolic BP -13 +/- 4%, P < 0.05 except systolic BP, where P = 0.09). Thus LF variability is reduced when sympathetic activation is induced by alpha-adrenergic blockade. This suggests that alpha-adrenergic transmission within the baroreflex loop may contribute importantly to the predominance of LF cardiovascular variability associated with sympathetic excitation in humans."

In ten patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and seven patients with other B-cell chronic leukemias (BCL), we have studied the intracellular 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2,5OAS) activity of the mononuclear cells before, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after pentostatin administration. In patients with HCL the median level of intracellular 2,5OAS increased 4.6-fold at 4 h and 11.5-fold at 24 h compared to the pretreatment value. Among the other seven patients, the median intracellular 2,5OAS remained unchanged in three patients and rose slightly by 2 to 14 times in four patients. Eleven patients (eight with HCL and two with BCL) responded to pentostatin. The median increase in 2,5OAS among the responders was 13.0-fold (range 4.8-30.0) whereas that among non-responders was 2.2-fold (range 0.2-6.3). The difference was highly significant (p less than 0.0001). In five of the total seventeen patients, the plasma levels of 2,5OAS activity were also determined and changes in plasma levels paralleled those measured intracellularly. To determine if the elevation of 2,5OAS is mediated by induction of interferon alpha, the expressions of mRNA for interferon alpha and beta were investigated by means of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction using the corresponding sense primers. In none of the five patients thus studied could we find an induction of mRNA for interferon alpha or beta in the leukemic cells during treatment with pentostatin. Thus, response to pentostatin correlates with induction of 2,5OAS directly and the 2',5'-oligoadenylate system seems to be involved in cytotoxicity."
False,mechanisms vitamin analogues promote apoptosis tumour cells unclearnan,11165041,vitamin D,tumour,"Mechanisms by which vitamin D analogues promote apoptosis in tumour cells are unclear. In this study we have examined possible interactions between the synthetic vitamin D analogue CB1093 and two other known mediators of apoptosis, TNFalpha and ceramide, in MCF-7, T47D and Hs578T breast cancer cells. These studies indicated that cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) is involved in CB1093 as well as TNFalpha-mediated cell death. CB1093 promoted both TNFalpha and ceramide-induced c-PLA(2) activation, which was inversely related to loss of cell viability in MCF-7 and Hs578T cells. TNFalpha alone (5-20 ng/ml) failed to induce cytotoxicity and activation of cPLA(2) in T47D cells. However, pretreatment of these cells with CB1093 potentiated C(2)-ceramide-induced cPLA(2) activation and cell death. Treatment with CB1093 alone induced loss of cell viability and DNA fragmentation in all three cell lines by 5 days and these effects were accompanied by activation of cPLA(2). Furthermore, co-treatment with the cPLA(2) inhibitor AACOCF(3) led to partial protection against loss of cell viability induced by CB1093 in Hs578T and T47D cells as well as MCF-7 cells. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk prevented TNFalpha but not C(2)-ceramide and CB1093-mediated release of arachidonic acid and cell death in MCF-7 cells. These results indicate that CB1093 potentiates responsiveness of breast cancer cells to TNFalpha and suggest that ceramide and/or cPLA(2) might be involved as downstream effectors in vitamin D-mediated caspase-independent cell death."

The relationships between plasma baseline pre-drug GABA concentrations and cognitive impairments induced by an acute oral dose of lorazepam (0.5 and 1.0 mg) were investigated in 22 healthy elderly individuals. Partial correlations controlling for plasma lorazepam concentrations revealed no significant relationship between baseline plasma GABA levels and lorazepam-induced impairments on tests of cognitive functioning. Plasma GABA concentration does not appear to be a useful marker of susceptibility to benzodiazepine-induced cognitive toxicity in the elderly. Other approaches to estimating central GABA activity should be pursued."

True,apparent calcium chloride dissociate vocalization fighting autonomic motor phenomena mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsions caused carbachol eserine nan,6892185,eserine,mydriasis,"The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."
False,medical treatment breast cancer bone metastasis bisphosphonates targeted drugsnan,24641358,bisphosphonates,metastasis,"Breast cancer bone metastasis causing severe morbidity is commonly encountered in daily clinical practice. It causes pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord and other nerve compression syndromes and life threatening hypercalcemia. Breast cancer metastasizes to bone through complicated steps in which numerous molecules play roles. Metastatic cells disrupt normal bone turnover and create a vicious cycle to which treatment efforts should be directed. Bisphosphonates have been used safely for more than two decades. As a group they delay time to first skeletal related event and reduce pain, but do not prevent development of bone metastasis in patients with no bone metastasis, and also do not prolong survival. The receptor activator for nuclear factor κB ligand inhibitor denosumab delays time to first skeletal related event and reduces the skeletal morbidity rate. Radionuclides are another treatment option for bone pain. New targeted therapies and radionuclides are still under investigation. In this review we will focus on mechanisms of bone metastasis and its medical treatment in breast cancer patients."

True,group four monkeys rendered parkinsonian toxin mptp nan,8106150,MPTP,parkinsonian,"A group of four monkeys was rendered parkinsonian with the toxin MPTP. They were then treated chronically with L-DOPA/benserazide 50/12.5 mg/kg given orally daily for 2 months. This dose produced a striking antiparkinsonian effect, but all animals manifested dyskinesia. A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than dopamine were then tested in combination with L-DOPA to see if the dyskinetic movements would be modified. Several drugs, including clonidine, physostigmine, methysergide, 5-MDOT, propranolol, and MK-801, markedly reduced the dyskinetic movements but at the cost of a return of parkinsonian symptomatology. However, yohimbine and meperidine reduced predominantly the dyskinetic movements. Baclofen was also useful in one monkey against a more dystonic form of dyskinesia. Atropine converted the dystonic movements into chorea."
False,caffeine tea also important tea prevent tumorigenesis nan,10786933,Caffeine,tumorigenesis,"Tea is one of the most widely consumed beverages, second only to water. Many experimental researches in laboratory animals demonstrated that tea components had an inhibitory effect on carcinogenesis at a number of organ sites. The inhibitory effects of tea against carcinogenesis have been attributed to the biologic activities of the polyphenol fraction in tea. This review summarizes experimental data on chemopreventive effects of tea polyphenols in various tumor bioassay systems. Many laboratory studies have demonstrated the inhibitory effects of green tea polyphenols, especially (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), on carcinogenesis in animals models. The majority of these studies have been conducted in mouse skin tumor models, where tea polyphenols were used either as oral feeding in drinking water or in direct local application. Most studies used 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or ultraviolet (UV) radiation as the tumor promoter and found anticarcinogenic effects caused by green tea polyphenols. Black tea was also found to be effective, although the activity was weaker than that of green tea in some experiments. Other studies showed that black tea polyphenols-theaflavins exhibited stronger anticarcinogenic activity than did EGCG. Caffeine in tea was also important for tea to prevent tumorigenesis. The molecular mechanisms of the cancer chemopreventive effects of tea polyphenols are not completely understood. They are most likely related to the mechanisms of biochemical actions of tea polyphenols, which include antioxidative activities, modulation of xenobiotic metabolite enzymes and inhibition of tumor promotion. In addition, we have also proposed that tea polyphenols function as cancer chemopreventive agents through modulation of mitotic signal transduction. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this modulation need further investigation."
False,singleblind doubledummy multicentre study compared oral azithromycin administered tablets mg daily days versus oral pivampicillin mg twice daily days adults acute exacerbations chronic bronchitis needing parenteral antibiotic therapy hospitalization oxygen supportnan,10983860,azithromycin,bronchitis,"This single-blind, double-dummy, multicentre study compared oral azithromycin, administered as tablets, 500 mg once daily for 3 days, versus oral pivampicillin, 700 mg twice daily for 10 days, in adults with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (not needing parenteral antibiotic therapy, hospitalization or oxygen support). Clinical success (cure + improvement) rates were similar for both groups at the end of treatment (day 10; azithromycin, 124 of 133 [93%]; pivampicillin, 79 of 92 [86%]) and at follow-up (day 52; 98 of 126 [78%] versus 66 of 81 [81%]). The treatments produced similar levels of pathogen eradication at the end of treatment (49 of 54 [91%] versus 32 of 37 [86%]). Azithromycin-treated patients had significantly reduced chest discomfort at the end of treatment, and a trend towards improved lung function. The two groups were similar with respect to improvements in other clinical symptoms and patient well-being, and to the incidences of adverse events and treatment discontinuations. This oral azithromycin regime is an effective treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, similar in efficacy to the longer pivampicillin regime and may offer superior patient compliance."

True,massive proteinuria acute renal failure oral bisphosphonate alendronate administration patient focal segmental glomerulosclerosispatient developed acute renal failure taking bisphosphonate,18754075,bisphosphonate,acute renal failure,"A 61-year-old Japanese man with nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was initially responding well to steroid therapy. The amount of daily urinary protein decreased from 15.6 to 2.8 g. Within 14 days of the oral bisphosphonate (alendronate sodium) administration, the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12.8 g with acute renal failure. After discontinuing the oral alendronate, the patient underwent six cycles of hemodialysis and four cycles of LDL apheresis. Urinary volume and serum creatinine levels recovered to the normal range, with urinary protein disappearing completely within 40 days. This report demonstrates that not only intravenous, but also oral bisphosphonates can aggravate proteinuria and acute renal failure."
False,intrathecal ketamine reduces morphine requirements patients terminal cancer pain nan,8697554,ketamine,terminal cancer pain,Ketamine has been administered epidurally and intrathecally for operative and post-operative pain control. Animal studies showed potentiation of analgesia induced by ketamine and morphine. We hypothesized that intrathecal ketamine would potentiate the effects of intrathecal morphine in the treatment of cancer pain.
True,cholelithiasis associated medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy mennan,1385654,medroxyprogesterone acetate,Cholelithiasis,"Five out of forty-five adult men, 50 years of age or less, who had received, for at least six months, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, Depo Provera) IM, 200-400 mg/week, for prevention of sex-offending or genital-mutilating behavior developed symptomatic cholelithiasis. Thirty of these men were studied with gallbladder ultrasound prospectively off MPA and at six-month intervals while taking the medication and then six months off MPA. Gallstones recovered from two patients were found to have very high cholesterol content, suggesting they were formed in cholesterol supersaturated bile. These findings are consistent with the increased incidence of gallbladder disease related to high-progesterone states and suggest that MPA may be a causative agent in cholelithiasis. The physiologic studies on gallbladder contraction and cholecystokinin release in a subset of the patients failed to provide information on a mechanism for the possible increased incidence of gallbladder disease."
False,maximum daily dose sertraline mg depressive symptoms adverse events assessed weeklynan,1480728,sertraline,Depressive symptoms,"One hundred patients with major depression who had discontinued fluoxetine because of side effects were enrolled in a multicenter, open, 8-week study of sertraline. After a washout period of at least 3 weeks following fluoxetine discontinuation and an additional 1-week, single-blind, placebo washout period, patients began treatment with 50 mg sertraline once daily. Based on the clinician's judgment of patient response, doses were titrated upward if necessary. The maximum daily dose of sertraline was 200 mg. Depressive symptoms and adverse events were assessed weekly. An interim analysis was conducted of the first 93 patients who completed the study. Of 91 evaluable patients, 69 sertraline-treated patients (75.8%) experienced significant improvement in depression. Only 8 of 93 patients (8.6%) discontinued sertraline because of side effects."

False,according flow cytometric analysis curcumin treatment resulted gm arrest ags cells accompanied increased expression cyclin decreased expression cyclinnan,25492214,curcumin,AGS,"Curcumin, the biologically active compound from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, could inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in gastric carcinoma. However, the underlying mechanism of curcumin on gastric carcinoma cells still needs further investigation. In this study, morphological observation indicated that curcumin inhibited the proliferation of AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner. According to the flow cytometric analysis, curcumin treatment resulted in G2/M arrest in AGS cells, accompanied with an increased expression of cyclin B1 and a decreased expression of cyclin D1. In addition, DNA ladders were observed by gel electrophoresis. Meanwhile, the activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9 were also enhanced in curcumin-treated AGS cells. Nevertheless, the increased activities could be inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OME)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), which suggested that the apoptosis was caspase-dependent. Furthermore, downregulation of rat sarcoma (Ras) and upregulation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were also observed in AGS cells treated with curcumin by Western blot. U0126, an ERK inhibitor, blocked curcumin-induced apoptosis. The results suggested that curcumin inhibited the growth of the AGS cells and induced apoptosis through the activation of Ras/ERK signaling pathway and downstream caspase cascade, and curcumin might be a potential target for the treatment of gastric carcinoma.

False,comparative study efficacy coumadin aspirin primary cardioembolic stroke prevention chronic rheumatic heart disease mitral stenosis atrial fibrillation conducted siriraj hospital mahidol university bangkok thailandnan,7798824,coumadin,cardioembolic stroke,"The comparative study of the efficacy of coumadin and aspirin in primary cardioembolic stroke prevention of chronic rheumatic heart disease (mitral stenosis) with atrial fibrillation was conducted at Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the trial. Allocation of patients into coumadin or aspirin groups depended upon the patients' choice. Nineteen patients were given coumadin at the adjusted dosage to maintain the therapeutic range of International Normalised Ratio between 1.5-3. Sixty patients were given aspirin at the fixed dosage of 75 mg per day. Six patients were lost to follow-up over the 3 yr period; four in the aspirin group and 2 in the coumadin group. There were three patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke in the aspirin group but none in the coumadin group after three years of follow-up. Six patients had mitral valve replacement during the study (i.e. three patients in each group). There were complications in 12 patients, 10 in the aspirin (16.6 per cent) and 2 in the coumadin (10.5 per cent) group. The complications in coumadin group were minor bleeding over the thigh in one patient and generalised ecchymosis over the whole body in one other. In the aspirin group, the complication was gastrointestional symptoms, mainly epigastric pain, but no frank bleeding was observed. Primary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in chronic rheumatic heart disease was found to be more effective with coumadin than aspirin. Our study does not support the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiac embolism in chronic rheumatic heart disease."
True,ramosetron potent selective serotonin ht receptor antagonist shown affect abnormal colonic function abdominal pain animalsnan,17323187,Ramosetron,abdominal pain,"Ramosetron is a potent and selective serotonin (5-HT)(3) receptor antagonist that has been shown to affect abnormal colonic function and abdominal pain in animals. Ramosetron (0.3 to 100 microg/kg, p.o.) has been found to significantly suppress abnormal defecation induced by conditioned-fear stress (CFS), restraint stress, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and 5-HT in rats and mice, and these effects were more potent than those of alosetron, cilansetron or loperamide. On the other hand, ramosetron (3,000 microg/kg, p. o., once daily for 7 days) did not inhibit normal defecation in dogs while tiquizium significantly inhibited it. Ramosetron (3 to 100 microg/kg, p. o.) also significantly prevented CFS-induced acceleration of colonic transit and CRF-induced abnormal water transport in rats, respectively. Moreover, ramosetron (0.3 to 3 microg/kg, p. o.) significantly suppressed restraint stress-induced decrease in colonic pain threshold, an effect not observed with loperamide. These results indicate that ramosetron produce beneficial clinical effects on IBS symptoms."
True,imatinib molecularly targeted therapy inhibits oncogenic fusion protein bcrabl tyrosine kinase involved pathogenesis chronic myelogenous leukemia cml nan,15215876,tyrosine,CML/chronic myelogenous leukemia,"Imatinib is a molecularly targeted therapy that inhibits the oncogenic fusion protein BCR-ABL, the tyrosine kinase involved in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Selective inhibition of BCR-ABL activity by imatinib has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of CML, particularly in chronic phase. Some patients, however, primarily those with advanced disease, are either refractory to imatinib or eventually relapse. Relapse with imatinib frequently depends not only on re-emergence of BCR-ABL kinase activity but may also indicate BCR-ABL-independent disease progression not amenable to imatinib inhibition. Results from phase 2/3 trials suggest that rates of resistance and relapse correlate with the stage of disease and with the monitoring parameters--hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular response. These observations and more recent trials with imatinib, combined with insights provided by an increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of resistance, have established the rationale for strategies to avoid and overcome imatinib resistance in the management of CML patients. To prevent resistance, early diagnosis and prompt treatment with appropriate initial dosing is essential. Management of resistance may include therapeutic strategies such as dose escalation to achieve individual optimal levels, combination therapy, as well as treatment interruption."
True,olanzapine like risperidone also associated onset mania adultsnan,11772153,Olanzapine,mania,"Antipsychotics are frequently used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Atypical antipsychotics have come to the forefront in child psychiatry due largely to their tolerability profiles as well as their efficacy. Potential treatment options include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. A number of studies investigating the use of clozapine have been published in children; however, owing to the frequent monitoring required for agranulocytosis, the use of clozapine may be restricted to patients with treatment-refractory disease. With accumulating data on the development of glucose intolerance in adults receiving clozapine, closer monitoring of bodyweight and fasting blood glucose is imperative. Clozapine also has an increased seizure risk, therefore a baseline electroencephalogram should be performed, as well as continued vigilance for this adverse effect. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that is generally well tolerated and numerous studies have been published investigating this drug in children. Unlike clozapine, its receptor interaction profile lends itself toward increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinaemia. Bodyweight gain is a common adverse effect, although somewhat less than that reported with olanzapine. Baseline liver function studies prior to initiation of this medication are recommended. Risperidone-induced mania has been reported in adults and, therefore, increased caution should be used when deciding to treat children and adolescents with risperidone, particularly in those with a predisposition toward mania. Olanzapine, like risperidone, has also been associated with onset of mania in adults. Olanzapine has a receptor profile that results in significant risk for bodyweight gain and sedation. Furthermore, this drug has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance; thus, it is important to monitor bodyweight and fasting blood glucose on a frequent basis. Less information is known about quetiapine in children and adolescents. Reports about its efficacy and tolerability vary. Quetiapine appears to have increased risk for sedation and bodyweight gain, albeit less than that of olanzapine. The compound appears to be less likely to induce EPS. Finally, ziprasidone has recently been approved for use in the adult population. This compound, in terms of its receptor profile, has more in common with risperidone. This suggests a potential for increased risk of EPS and hyperprolactinaemia. It also has an increased risk of QTc prolongation; thus, a baseline electrocardiogram is suggested, particularly in those patients with a history of cardiovascular illness. Lack of evidence for bodyweight gain with ziprasidone is a considerable advantage."

FTY was started 3.5 months after a two-year NZB treatment. Fifteen days later, she suffered partial repetitive seizures followed by a tonicoclonic seizure. This was associated with attention difficulties and an increased asthenia. Brain MRI follow-up disclosed large demyelinating active lesions in favour of disease reactivation. This case suggests that FTY introduction may occur less than three months after NZB withdrawal."

True,refractory gcse often difficult treat traditional therapy barbiturates induces hypotension respiratory depression prolongs recoverynan,10516875,barbiturates,hypotension,"Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is a medical emergency requiring prompt resolution. Acute treatment is often delayed by difficulty in obtaining intravenous (i.v.) access. Refractory GCSE is often difficult to treat, and traditional therapy with barbiturates induces hypotension and respiratory depression and prolongs recovery. Midazolam is particularly useful for treating acute GCSE because it has an imidazole ring that is open at low pH, allowing it to be dissolved in aqueous solution for intramuscular injection, but closed at physiologic pH, increasing lipophilicity and rendering good intramuscular absorption, brain penetration, and fast onset of action. When given intramuscularly as a 0.2 mg/kg bolus, it has efficacy at least equal to that of i.v. diazepam, is well tolerated, induces little respiratory compromise, and has a shorter latency to onset of action. Therefore, it should be considered for the treatment of acute GCSE when i.v. access is problematic. For refractory GCSE, continuous i.v. midazolam infusion at 0.1-0.6 mg/kg/hr after a 0.2 mg/kg i.v. bolus is effective and has advantages over traditional therapies because it induces less hypotension and cardiorespiratory depression and can be easily titrated. Further prospective studies are needed to define the role of continuous i.v. midazolam compared to other contemporary therapies."

True,however relative contribution aluminum lithium human toxicity ecotoxicity could estimated due insufficient toxicity data modelsnan,23638841,lithium,toxicity,"Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-polymer (Li-poly) batteries have recently become dominant in consumer electronic products because of advantages associated with energy density and product longevity. However, the small size of these batteries, the high rate of disposal of consumer products in which they are used, and the lack of uniform regulatory policy on their disposal means that lithium batteries may contribute substantially to environmental pollution and adverse human health impacts due to potentially toxic materials. In this research, we used standardized leaching tests, life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and hazard assessment models to evaluate hazardous waste classification, resource depletion potential, and toxicity potentials of lithium batteries used in cellphones. Our results demonstrate that according to U.S. federal regulations, defunct Li-ion batteries are classified hazardous due to their lead (Pb) content (average 6.29 mg/L; σ = 11.1; limit 5). However, according to California regulations, all lithium batteries tested are classified hazardous due to excessive levels of cobalt (average 163,544 mg/kg; σ = 62,897; limit 8000), copper (average 98,694 mg/kg; σ = 28,734; limit 2500), and nickel (average 9525 mg/kg; σ = 11,438; limit 2000). In some of the Li-ion batteries, the leached concentrations of chromium, lead, and thallium exceeded the California regulation limits. The environmental impact associated with resource depletion and human toxicity is mainly associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver, whereas the ecotoxicity potential is primarily associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver. However, the relative contribution of aluminum and lithium to human toxicity and ecotoxicity could not be estimated due to insufficient toxicity data in the models. These findings support the need for stronger government policy at the local, national, and international levels to encourage recovery, recycling, and reuse of lithium battery materials."

(FXE), are believed to be the active compounds responsible for the previously reported hypoglycemic effects of this extract. In this study, the effects of FXE were studied in two animal models which are representative of metabolic disorders: spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and obese Zucker rats. SHR were acutely treated (oral gavage) with different doses of FXE. In addition, SHR and Zucker rats were chronically fed (20 or 5 weeks, respectively) with standard chow supplemented with FXE. Acute treatment with FXE (200 mg per kg body weight) decreased systolic blood pressure as in the case with captopril (50 mg per kg body weight). Chronic treatment with FXE at 100 mg per kg body weight per day, a dose equivalent to that showing hypoglycemic activity in humans, resulted in a significant decrease in glycemia (-16.3%), triglyceridemia (-33.4%) and body weight (-8.1%) in Zucker rats as well as a significant decrease in SBP in SHR (-6.7%), with a concomitant improvement in endothelial function in both strains. The broad-ranging effects of FXE may be due to a unique compositional profile that could be useful to prevent the metabolic syndrome, characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia and elevated blood pressure."
True,presence methane lactulose breath testing associated constipationpredominant ibs nan,17713456,methane,IBS,"An overlap of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) exists across subtype groups. Symptoms include intestinal gas, diarrhea, dyspepsia, bloating, abdominal pain, and constipation. The unifying symptom may be excessive intestinal gas as a by-product of intestinal microbial fermentation. Abnormal fermentation of food takes place when gut microbes expand proximally into the small intestine instead of being confined predominantly to the colon. Such proximal expansion of indigenous gut microbes or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may lead to activation of host mucosal immunity and an increase in intestinal permeability to result in flu-like extra-intestinal symptoms that accompany the classic IBS symptoms of altered bowels. The presence of methane on lactulose breath testing is associated with constipation-predominant IBS. Antibiotic therapy may be appropriate to treat underlying SIBO in IBS patients. Seventy-five percent improvement of IBS symptoms was reported in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study once antibiotics succeeded in treating bacterial overgrowth. Once a good clinical response and normalization of the lactulose breath test are achieved, a prokinetic agent may be used to stimulate phase III of interdigestive motility to delay relapse of bacterial overgrowth."
False,bortezomib enhanced susceptibility trail  escc cell lines tested although showed low sensitivity trail single agentnan,20515944,Bortezomib,ESCC,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most aggressive human cancers, and novel treatment modalities are required. We investigated the therapeutic potential of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) in combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) on human ESCC cell lines. Bortezomib enhanced the susceptibility to TRAIL in 12 of the 15 ESCC cell lines tested, although most showed low sensitivity to TRAIL as a single agent. The enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by bortezomib was caspase dependent. Increased processing of caspase-8 often accompanied enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by bortezomib. However, the increased cell surface expression of death receptors observed on bortezomib treatment did not seem to be crucial for this effect. For some ESCC, bortezomib treatment resulted in a more efficient recruitment of caspase-8 and the Fas-associated death domain to the death-inducing signaling complex. Additional downregulation of the cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein long isoform [c-FLIP(L)] could cooperate in the activation of the extrinsic pathway in some cases. For other ESCC, the crucial effect of bortezomib treatment seemed to be increased signaling via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway on subsequent exposure to TRAIL. Thus, bortezomib could sensitize ESCC to TRAIL apoptosis by multiple molecular mechanisms of action. Therefore, the combination of bortezomib and TRAIL might be a novel therapeutic strategy for ESCC patients who fail to respond to standard chemoradiotherapy that predominantly targets the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway."

False,however cisplatinresistant subpopulation ddp showed highest glutathione level marked cross-resistance bleomycinnan,8898974,glutathione,cross-resistance,"Glutathione has a variety of important physiological functions in cellular metabolism and defense, including protection from radicals, oxidative stress, and electrophilic compounds. On the basis of this interaction with both endogenous and synthetic substances, glutathione and the key enzyme for its conjugation, glutathione S-transferase, appear to be critical determinants in tumor cell resistance to several antineoplastic drugs, e.g. platinum analogs. In ten established head and neck cancer cell lines (UM-SCC 10A, 10B, 11B, 14A, 14B, 14C, and 22B, HLac79, 8029NA, and 8029DDP4) chemosensitivity to cisplatin, carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and bleomycin, as well as cellular glutathione content and activity of glutathione S-transferase were determined. The results revealed no correlation between the sensitivity of tumor cells to any of the drugs tested and the level of glutathione or the activity of glutathione S-transferase. However, the cisplatin-resistant subpopulation 8029DDP4 showed the highest glutathione level and marked cross-resistance to bleomycin. Glutathione depletion with buthionine sulfoximine led to moderately increased sensitivity towards cisplatin and carboplatin in all cell lines, but did not affect their response to 5-fluorouracil or bleomycin. These results suggest that the level of glutathione or the activity of glutathione S-transferase is not a suitable parameter for the assessment of chemosensitivity in head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma lines. However, response to platinum analogs is influenced by alterations of the initial intracellular glutathione concentration."

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of exogenous catecholamines on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and beta(beta)-endorphin levels in patients with severe trauma, during the first 24 h after injury. Forty four traumatized patients with haemorrhage class III and IV were included in the study. Patients were divided in two groups: Group 1 (adrenergic, n=22) and Group 2 (non adrenergic, n=22), depending on the use of exogenous catecholamines. Blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4 and 24 h time points. Baseline values were different between the two groups, but an altered pattern of release was observed for TNFa, IL-6, IL-10 and beta-endorphin levels in patients treated with catecholamines. ICU stay was longer for the adrenergic group, while survival after 1 month was significantly lower. Findings support an altered pattern of cytokine release during the early phase after trauma, probably due to catecholamine presence."

We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with 492K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample of 738 patients with schizophrenia from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness study. Outcome variables consisted of a neurocognitive battery administered at multiple time points over an 18-month period, measuring processing speed, verbal memory, vigilance, reasoning, and working memory domains. Genetic mediation of improvements in each of these five domains plus a composite neurocognitive measure was assessed for each of five antipsychotics (olanzapine, perphenazine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone). Six SNPs achieved genome-wide significance using a pre-specified threshold that ensures, on average, only 1 in 10 findings is a false discovery. These six SNPs were located within, or in close proximity to, genes EHF, SLC26A9, DRD2, GPR137B, CHST8, and IL1A. The more robust findings, that is those significant across multiple neurocognitive domains and having adjacent SNPs showing evidence for association, were rs286913 at the EHF gene (p-value 6.99 × 10(-8), q-value 0.034, mediating the effects of ziprasidone on vigilance), rs11240594 at SLC26A9 (p-value 1.4 × 10(-7), q-value 0.068, mediating the effects of olanzapine on processing speed), and rs11677416 at IL1A (p-value 6.67 × 10(-7), q-value 0.081, mediating the effects of olanzapine on working memory). This study has generated several novel candidate genes for antipsychotic response. However, our findings will require replication and functional validation. To facilitate replication efforts, we provide all GWAS p-values for download."
True,serotonin syndrome venlafaxine tranylcypromine interactionnan,8888541,venlafaxine,Serotonin syndrome,"Excessive stimulation of serotonin 5HT1A receptors causes a syndrome of serotonin excess that consists of shivering, muscle rigidity, salivation, confusion, agitation and hyperthermia. The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. We report a venlafaxine-MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23-y-old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression. He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1/2 tab of venlafaxine. Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities, tremors and rigidity. He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering, myoclonic jerks, rigidity, salivation and diaphoresis. His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light. Vital signs were: blood pressure 120/67 mm Hg, heart rate 127/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and temperature 97 F. After 180 mg of diazepam i.v. he remained tremulous with muscle rigidity and clenched jaws. He was intubated for airway protection and because of hypoventilation, and was paralyzed to control muscle rigidity. His subsequent course was remarkable for non-immune thrombocytopenia which resolved. The patient's maximal temperature was 101.2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units/L with no other evidence of rhabdomyolysis. His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward. This patient survived without sequelae due to the aggressive sedation and neuromuscular paralysis."
True,toxicity acrylamide evaluation exposure baby foodsnan,20843409,acrylamide,Toxicity,"Contaminants are a vast subject area of food safety and quality and can be present in our food chain from raw materials to finished products. Acrylamide, an α,β-unsaturated (conjugated) reactive molecule, can be detected as a contaminant in several foodstuffs including baby foods and infant formulas. It is anticipated that children will generally have intakes that are two to three times those of adults when expressed on a body-weight basis. Though exposure to acrylamide is inevitable, it is necessary to protect infant and children from high exposure. The present review focuses on the several adverse health effects of acrylamide including mutagenicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, and the possible outcomes of childhood exposure from baby foods and infant formulas."

Seizures are one of these adverse effects. Almost all first and second generation antipsychotics elicit dose-dependent lowering of seizure threshold, indicating increased seizure risk at higher drug dosages. The adverse event of zotepine induced seizure is published in few case reports. We report the occurrence of myoclonic seizure progressing to generalized tonic-clonic seizures with zotepine along with clear temporal association of dose dependent modulation evident in this case."

The use of amiodarone has, however, been limited due to its serious side-effects. A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to amiodarone treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is given. It is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic injury due to amiodarone treatment, including steatosis, alterations resembling alcoholic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis of the liver. Patients receiving amiodarone should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels. Therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of cholestatic injury or hepatomegaly."
True,iron ions produced cytotoxicity towards kinds cells dependent concentrationnan,11243246,Iron,cytotoxicity,"We investigated survival of two kinds of human embryonic cells (CLV102, Lu106) and human melanoma cells (Mel8) exposed to exogenous iron and copper ions in the absence or in the presence of ascorbic acid, catalase and superoxide dismutase. Iron ions produced cytotoxicity towards both kinds of cells dependent on its concentration. Catalase suppressed the cytotoxicity induced by iron ions in Lu106 cells. whereas in CLV102 and Mel8 cells, was ineffective. By contrast, superoxide dismutase abolished the cytotoxicity of iron ions towards CLV102 cells, whereas in Lu106 and Mel8 cells, was ineffective. The mixture of iron ions with ascorbic acid was less cytotoxic than iron ions themselves or ascorbic acid itself, only in CLV102 and Lu106 cells. Ascorbic acid enhanced drastically cytotoxic effect of copper ions in all kinds of cells."

False,study investigated effect intravenous infusions lidocaine pain quality life patients fibromyalgianan,19263182,lidocaine,pain,"Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by chronic widespread pain. In this study, we investigated the effect of intravenous infusions of lidocaine in pain and quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia. Twenty-three consecutive patients were included in the study, which consisted on five sequential intravenous 2% lidocaine infusions with rising dosages (2-5 mg/kg, days 1-5). Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Health Assessment Questionnaire, and a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain were applied before the first lidocaine infusion, immediately after the fifth infusion and 30 days after the fifth infusion. A significant improvement was observed in the FIQ scores after the fifth infusion (73.52 +/- 16.56 vs 63.29 +/- 21.21, p = 0.02), which was maintained after 30 days (73.52 +/- 16.56 vs 63.85 +/- 24.59, p = 0.04). Similar results were seen concerning the VAS: 8.19 +/- 1.76 vs 6.84 +/- 2.44, p = 0.01 and 8.19 +/- 1.76 vs 7.17 +/- 2.35, p = 0.05, respectively. Intravenous lidocaine infusions are safe and effective in the management of fibromyalgia."
False,investigated effect levodopa mood anxiety eight parkinson's disease patients motor fluctuationsnan,7675241,levodopa,Parkinson's disease,"We investigated the effect of levodopa on mood and anxiety in eight Parkinson's disease patients with motor fluctuations. Each patient received 0.0-, 0.5-, and 1.0-mg/kg/hr levodopa infusions in randomly assigned order under double-blind conditions on consecutive days. Mood elevation and anxiety reduction based on half-hourly patient rating and a corresponding increase in tapping speed occurred with active drug infusion but not placebo infusion. The effects were dose related. The higher-dose infusion rate produced more rapid onset, greater magnitude, and longer duration of response. We conclude that mood and anxiety fluctuations related to levodopa dosing are robust pharmacologic, and not placebo, effects."

True,microtubule inhibitor mtibased chemotherapies used treatment breast cancerincluding vinca alkaloids taxanes epothilones known associated peripheral neuropathy nan,18567992,epothilones,peripheral neuropathy,"Microtubule inhibitor (MTI)-based chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer--including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones--are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone."
False,omega fatty acids shown reduce platelet endothelial activation patients risk cardiac disease nan,22296885,Omega-3 fatty acids,cardiac disease,Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce platelet and endothelial activation in patients with or at risk of cardiac disease. We aimed to determine if Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in addition to best medical therapy can reduce the increased platelet and endothelial activity that is present in patients with intermittent claudication.
True,receiving silicone injections buttock patient developed rapid onset dyspnea pleuritic chest pain fever chillsnan,22288970,silicone,fever,"Silicone, commonly used in cosmetic procedures owing to its presumed inertness, can yield serious sequelae including acute embolization and pneumonitis. Chronic pulmonary sequelae in response to silicone injection have not been previously described. We report a case of chronic progressive granulomatous pneumonitis in response to subcutaneous silicone injections in a transgender male-to-female patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). After receiving silicone injections to the buttock, the patient developed rapid onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and chills. Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse peripheral interstitial opacities. She responded symptomatically to prednisone with subsequent intermittent symptomatic flares. Four years later, she developed marked dyspnea and cough. Chest computed tomography showed progressive diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities. Lung biopsies demonstrated numerous spheroid silicone particles within the lung interstitium and small pulmonary vessels, surrounded by foreign body giant cells and nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation. We speculate that HIV-1-infected patients may be at risk for chronic, progressive granulomatous pneumonitis due to silicone injection years after their procedure owing to shifting levels of cell-mediated immunity."
False,minireview discuss general mechanisms resistance ardirected therapies focus role androgen receptor splice variants new era treating advanced prostate cancer enzalutamide abirateronenan,25048254,enzalutamide,prostate cancer,"The FDA approvals of enzalutamide and abiraterone have rapidly changed the clinical landscape of prostate cancer treatment. Both drugs were designed to further suppress androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which is restored following first-line androgen deprivation therapies. Resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone, however, is again marked by a return of AR signaling, indicating a remarkable ""addiction"" of prostate cancer cells to the AR pathway. Several mechanisms of castration resistance have been uncovered in the past decades, featuring a wide spectrum of molecular alterations that may explain sustained AR signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). Among these, the androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs), particularly variant 7 (AR-V7), have been implicated in resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone in preclinical studies, and they cannot be targeted by currently available AR-directed drugs. Drug development for AR-V-associated CRPC may therefore be necessary to augment the preexisting treatment repertoire. In this mini-review, we will discuss general mechanisms of resistance to AR-directed therapies, with a focus on the role of androgen receptor splice variants in the new era of treating advanced prostate cancer with enzalutamide and abiraterone.

False,cystic fibrosis cf lung disease exhaled nitric oxide feno raised rather normal even decreased measured single expiratory flownan,19669109,nitric oxide,cystic fibrosis/CF,"In cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is not raised, but rather is normal or even decreased when measured at a single expiratory flow. FeNO measurements at several flow rates allow differentiation between alveolar and bronchial nitric oxide (NO) production. Extended FeNO measurements therefore should be useful to localize the FeNO deficit in CF airways. FeNO was measured in stable CF adults with moderate lung disease and in healthy controls. Bronchial NO fluxes (J(NO,Br)) and alveolar NO concentrations (C(Alv)) were calculated from FeNO measurements at flow rates of 100, 150 and 200 ml/s using a method previously described. Thirty-two adults were included in the study, 12 of whom had CF. CF adults had significantly lower FeNO values at all flow rates. The median J(NO,Br) was significantly lower in CF adults than in healthy controls [0.31 nl/s (range = 0.11-0.63) vs. 0.70 nl/s (0.27-3.52); P < 0.001], while the median C(Alv) was similar in both groups [1.7 ppb (0.3-3.9) vs. 1.2 (0.1-5.2)]. Pulmonary NO exchange did not differ significantly between subgroups of CF patients with and without chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. No significant correlation was detectable between FEV(1)/VC and J(NO,Br) and C(Alv), respectively. Extended FeNO measurements can separate alveolar and bronchial NO outputs in CF adults. The lower FeNO in adults with moderate to severe CF lung disease is likely to be the result of lower bronchial NO output."

False,emergence lrsa serious concern cf patients undergo prolonged courses lzd therapynan,21263048,LZD,CF,"Linezolid (LZD)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LRSA) isolates were monitored from 2000 to 2009 in Cleveland, OH. LRSA first emerged in 2004 only in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, with 11 LRSA-infected CF patients being identified by 2009. LRSA was isolated from 8 of 77 CF patients with S. aureus respiratory tract infection treated with LZD from 2000 to 2006. Analysis of clinical data showed that the 8 CF patients with LRSA received more LZD courses (18.8 versus 5.9; P = 0.001) for a longer duration (546.5 versus 211.9 days; P < 0.001) and had extended periods of exposure to LZD (83.1 versus 30.1 days/year; P < 0.001) than the 69 with LZD-susceptible isolates. Five LRSA isolates included in the clinical analysis (2000 to 2006) and three collected in 2009 were available for molecular studies. Genotyping by repetitive extrapalindromic PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that seven of these eight LRSA strains from unique patients were genetically similar. By multilocus sequence typing, all LRSA isolates were included in clonal complex 5 (seven of sequence type 5 [ST5] and one of ST1788, a new single-locus variant of ST5). However, seven different variants were identified by spa typing. According to the Escherichia coli numbering system, seven LRSA isolates contained a G2576T mutation (G2603T, S. aureus numbering) in one to four of the five copies of domain V of the 23S rRNA genes. One strain also contained a mutation (C2461T, E. coli numbering) not previously reported. Two strains, including one without domain V mutations, possessed single amino acid substitutions (Gly152Asp or Gly139Arg) in the ribosomal protein L3 of the peptidyltransferase center, substitutions not previously reported in clinical isolates. Emergence of LRSA is a serious concern for CF patients who undergo prolonged courses of LZD therapy."
False,clinical trials demonstrated efficacy safety celecoxib rofecoxib postoperative pain preemptive analgesia newer agents valdecoxib etoricoxib also demonstrated efficacy settingsnan,12204484,valdecoxib,analgesia,"Management of acute postoperative pain remains suboptimal: nearly 80% of patients report moderate to extreme pain following surgery. New pain management paradigms incorporate multimodal analgesia, using a combination of analgesics throughout the perioperative period to control nociceptive and centrally-stimulated pain. Nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a role in postoperative pain management, but concerns about increased bleeding and inhibited wound healing and bone fusion have limited their use. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors (coxibs) offer the peripheral pain-relieving benefits of nonselective NSAIDs but with fewer adverse GI effects; they also may have a role in central sensitization. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of celecoxib and rofecoxib for postoperative pain and for preemptive analgesia, and newer agents such as valdecoxib and etoricoxib also have demonstrated efficacy in these settings. In addition to their selectivity for the COX-2 isozyme overall, unique differences among the coxibs, such as in plasma half-life, may impart certain clinical advantages."

Based on empirical drug limitations about 10-15% of patients will develop congestive heart failure (CHF) with a mortality of -50% within 2 years on digitalo-diuretic therapy alone. To avoid CHF there is a consensus recommendation that cardiac function should be monitored in close connection with anthracycline administration. As no prospective studies in a larger series have been performed, these recommendations are based on retrospective data on small numbers of patients."

True,however ascorbic acid metabolic precursor oxalate administration ascorbic acid high dose could lead acute oxalate nephropathy particularly presence renal failurenan,10382555,ascorbic acid,acute oxalate nephropathy,"Repeated topical exposure to chromium(VI) may cause an allergic contact dermatitis or the formation of chrome ulcers. Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III)."

True,documented airway occlusion sleep abnormally high supraglottic resistance awake yrold woman developed physical changes syndrome obstructive sleep apnea administered exogenous androgens nan,6732043,androgens,syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea,"We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54-yr-old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea while being administered exogenous androgens. When the androgens were withdrawn, the patient's physical changes, symptoms, sleep study, and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal. A rechallenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone. Previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. Our report provides direct evidence for this role. Structural and functional measurements indicate that androgens exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep. Development of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome must be considered a possible side effect of androgen therapy."
False,comparative study efficacy coumadin aspirin primary cardioembolic stroke prevention chronic rheumatic heart disease mitral stenosis atrial fibrillation conducted siriraj hospital mahidol university bangkok thailandnan,7798824,coumadin,atrial fibrillation,"The comparative study of the efficacy of coumadin and aspirin in primary cardioembolic stroke prevention of chronic rheumatic heart disease (mitral stenosis) with atrial fibrillation was conducted at Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the trial. Allocation of patients into coumadin or aspirin groups depended upon the patients' choice. Nineteen patients were given coumadin at the adjusted dosage to maintain the therapeutic range of International Normalised Ratio between 1.5-3. Sixty patients were given aspirin at the fixed dosage of 75 mg per day. Six patients were lost to follow-up over the 3 yr period; four in the aspirin group and 2 in the coumadin group. There were three patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke in the aspirin group but none in the coumadin group after three years of follow-up. Six patients had mitral valve replacement during the study (i.e. three patients in each group). There were complications in 12 patients, 10 in the aspirin (16.6 per cent) and 2 in the coumadin (10.5 per cent) group. The complications in coumadin group were minor bleeding over the thigh in one patient and generalised ecchymosis over the whole body in one other. In the aspirin group, the complication was gastrointestional symptoms, mainly epigastric pain, but no frank bleeding was observed. Primary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in chronic rheumatic heart disease was found to be more effective with coumadin than aspirin. Our study does not support the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiac embolism in chronic rheumatic heart disease."

Recent researchers indicate that the chemosensitivity of 5-FU for colorectal carcinoma with low expression of TS is better than tumors with high expression of TS. But the relation between TS expression and overall survival of curatively resected colorectal cancer patients has been less studied.

True,severe hypoaldosteronism due corticosterone methyl oxidase type ii deficiency two boys metabolic gas chromatographymass spectrometry studiesnan,2044581,corticosterone,hypoaldosteronism,"Infection-triggered, life-threatening salt-loss and hyperkalaemia developed in two male infants with wasting, inappropriately low plasma aldosterone concentrations and elevated plasma renin activity. The presumptive diagnosis of a defective terminal step in aldosterone biosynthesis was made by the presence of large amounts of 11-dehydrotetrahydrocorticosterone and its 18-hydroxylated metabolite (18-OH-THA), free 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OH-B) and 18-hydroxytetrahydrocorticosterone in the urine of both patients. The diagnosis of corticosterone methyl oxidase type II (CMO II) deficiency was confirmed by an elevated urinary 18-OH-THA to tetrahydroaldosterone ratio in one boy and by an elevated plasma 18-OH-B to aldosterone ratio in the other boy. Unknown steroids responsible for the salt-loss were not identified. Sodium supplementation but not short-term high dose oral 9 alpha-fluorcortisol (FF) normalized the hyponatraemia in one patient, in whom sodium (Na+)/potassium (K+) co-transport was decreased. Both patients eventually received long-term FF treatment to prevent impairment of longitudinal growth caused by chronic salt-loss. The diagnosis of CMO II deficiency should always be confirmed by elevated precursor-product ratios in urine or plasma, using radioimmunoassays with prior chromatographic separation. Metabolic studies as the short-term response of serum Na+ to high dose FF may not be helpful in differentiating aldosterone biosynthetic defects from end-organ resistance to mineralocorticoids."
True,pregabalin well tolerated common adverse events dizziness somnolence nan,16939547,Pregabalin,somnolence,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the tolerability, safety and efficacy of pregabalin in Indian patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. In this prospective, multicenter, non-comparative, open-label study, patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (n = 111) received pregabalin in doses ranging from 75 to 300 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. Primary efficacy measures included weekly pain score and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Despite a short study duration, a significant reduction was seen in weekly pain score (p < 0.0001), as well as VAS score of SF-MPQ (p < 0.0001). Significant improvements were also seen in other pain-related endpoints, weekly sleep interference score, quality of life measures, and patient and clinician ratings of global improvement. Pregabalin was well tolerated, and the most common adverse events were dizziness and somnolence. The short study duration precluded the assessment of longer term safety issues such as weight gain. This study has demonstrated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of pregabalin for peripheral neuropathic pain in Indian patients."
True,intravenous pretreatment rats diazepam although causing change adrenaline induced pressor effect enhance adrenaline induced reflex bradycardia nan,2894433,adrenaline,bradycardia,"The effects of diazepam on cardiovascular function were assessed in conscious rats. Intravenous administration of diazepam (1-30 mg kg-1) produced a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate. Also, reflex bradycardia was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of adrenaline (1.25-2.5 micrograms kg-1). Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with diazepam, although causing no change in the adrenaline-induced pressor effect, did enhance the adrenaline-induced reflex bradycardia. However, the diazepam enhancement of adrenaline-induced reflex bradycardia was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of picrotoxin (an agent blocks chloride channels by binding to sites associated with the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride channel macromolecular complex). The data indicate that diazepam acts through the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride channel macromolecular complex within the central nervous system to facilitate reflex bradycardia mediated through baroreceptor reflexes in response to an acute increase in arterial pressure."
True,reported short episodes transient visual disturbances appeared immediately starting treatment risperidone nan,12013711,risperidone,visual disturbances,"Two schizophrenic patients, who had a prior history of LSD abuse and who had previously developed EPS with classic antipsychotics, were successfully treated with risperidone. They both reported short episodes of transient visual disturbances, which appeared immediately after starting treatment with risperidone. This imagery resembled visual disturbances previously experienced as ""flashbacks"" related to prior LSD consumption. Risperidone administration was continued and the visual disturbances gradually wore off. During a six-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of visual disturbances. This phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign, short-term and self-limiting side effect which does not contraindicate the use of risperidone or interfere with treatment. Conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution."

Neostigmine, when given intrathecally, inhibits breakdown of an endogenous spinal neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, thereby inducing analgesia. We aimed to determine the analgesic and adverse effects of intrathecal neostigmine combined with hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl."
True,finally authors discuss implications bioaccessibility pah induced toxicity cancers context risk assessmentnan,23898780,PAH,cancers,"Bioaccessibility is a growing area of research in the field of risk assessment. As polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants, they are the toxicants of focus to establish cancer risks in humans. Orally ingested PAHs also cause toxicity and even affect the pharmacokinetic behavior of some therapeutic agents. Toward this end, bioaccessibility is being used as a tool to assess the risk of PAHs via dietary exposures."

Necrotic blisters were noted on his fingers. Skin biopsies showed findings diagnostic of leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Oxacillin was discontinued and patient was treated with corticosteroids. The rash disappeared after three weeks and renal function returned to normal. Leucocytoclastic vasculitis presents as palpable purpura of the lower extremities often accompanied by abdominal pain, arthralgia, and renal involvement. Etiologic factors or associated disorders include infections, medications, collagen vascular disease and neoplasia. However, in half of the cases no etiologic factor is identified. Usually it is a self-limited disorder, but corticosteroid therapy may be needed in life-threatening cases since early treatment with corticosteroids in severe cases can prevent complications. Oxacillin should be included among the drugs that can cause leucocytoclastic vasculitis."

True,article provides overview incidence characteristics management mtiassociated neurotoxicities known vinca alkaloids taxanes well newer agents vinflunine ixabepilone nan,18567992,ixabepilone,neurotoxicities,"Microtubule inhibitor (MTI)-based chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer--including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones--are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone."

Toxicity was higher in the rapid infusion group than it was in the slow infusion group (mean total 7-day chill score, 173 +/- 276 versus 20 +/- 30 [P less than 0.01]; mean total 7-day dosage of meperidine required to abate rigors, 180 +/- 133 versus 58 +/- 78 mg [P less than 0.05]; and mean maximum total 7-day pulse rise, 225 +/- 64 versus 135 +/- 56 beats per min [P less than 0.02], respectively). When analyzed on a daily basis, the mean chill score, meperidine dosage, and pulse rise were also higher; and in addition, nausea and vomiting (5 of 11 patients who received a rapid infusion versus 0 of 9 patients who received a slow infusion [P less than 0.01]) appeared to be more common in those who received amphotericin B rapidly. The daily analysis approach proved that tolerance to these side effects developed with each subsequent infusion day, and by day 7 the incidence and severity were the same. This development of tolerance was significant for the mean chill score in the rapid infusion group (P less than 0.05) and for the proportion of patients with chills (P less than 0.005 for the slow infusion group; P less than 0.05 for the rapid infusion group). A decrease in creatinine clearance to greater than 51% of the baseline value was seen in two patients in each group. There were five deaths (four in the rapid infusion group, 1 in the slow infusion group) within 1 month, but none was clearly related to the amphotericin B infusion. The mean time to defervescence was similar for each group (10.8 +/- 4.1 days in the slow infusion group versus 9.9 +/- 5 days in the rapid infusion group). A rapid infusion regimen for amphotericin B cannot be recommended, at least during the first 5 to 7 days of treatment."

False,although intravenous ribavirin effective children severe adenovirus disease series literature therapy unlikely benefit begun late course infection nan,12093990,ribavirin,infection,"Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host. The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia. The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity."
False,naloxone mgkg iv reversed respiratory paralysis glutamate gaba levels control values brain stem cortex changes caudate cerebellumnan,2893236,Naloxone,respiratory paralysis,"No agent is yet available to reverse respiratory paralysis produced by CNS depressants, such as general anesthetics. In this study naloxone reversed respiratory paralysis induced by thiopental in rats. 25 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate, increased GABA, decreased glutamate, and had no effect on aspartate or glycine levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem. Pretreatment of rats with thiosemicarbazide for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of thiopental. 50 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced respiratory arrest with further increase in GABA and decrease in glutamate again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the amino acids studied in four regions of rat brain. Naloxone (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) reversed respiratory paralysis, glutamate and GABA levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum. These data suggest naloxone reverses respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental and involves GABA in its action."
False,considering lack data regarding genotoxic effects compounds human cells objective study evaluate cytotoxicity genotoxicity expressions casp sod genes cultured human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line hepg cells treated artemisinin artesunatenan,23979886,artemisinin,carcinoma,"The malaria treatment recommended by the World Health Organization involves medicines derived from artemisinin, an active compound extracted from the plant Artemisia annua, and some of its derivatives, such as artesunate. Considering the lack of data regarding the genotoxic effects of these compounds in human cells, the objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, and expressions of the CASP3 and SOD1 genes in a cultured human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2 cells) treated with artemisinin and artesunate. We tested concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 μg/mL of both substances with a resazurin cytotoxicity assay, and the concentrations used in the genotoxicity experiments (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/mL) and gene expression analysis (5 μg/mL) were determined. The results of the comet assay in cells treated with artemisinin and artesunate showed a significant dose-dependent increase (P < 0.001) in the number of cells with DNA damage at all concentrations tested. However, the gene expression analysis revealed no significant change in expression of CASP3 or SOD1. Our data showed that although artemisinin and artesunate exhibited genotoxic effects in cultured HepG2 cells, they did not significantly alter expression of the CASP3 and SOD1 genes at the doses tested."
True,reversibility levobupivacaine induced cardiotoxicity also assessednan,11945112,levobupivacaine,cardiotoxicity,"Bupivacaine is currently the most widely used long-acting local anaesthetic. Its uses include surgery and obstetrics; however, it has been associated with potentially fatal cardiotoxicity, particularly when given intravascularly by accident. Levobupivacaine, a single enantiomer of bupivacaine, has recently been introduced as a new long-acting local anaesthetic with a potentially reduced toxicity compared with bupivacaine. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have compared levobupivacaine with bupivacaine and in most but not all studies there is evidence that levobupivacaine is less toxic. Advantages for levobupivacaine are seen on cardiac sodium and potassium channels, on isolated animal hearts and in whole animals, anaesthetised or awake. In particular the intravascular dose of levobupivacaine required to cause lethality in animals is consistently higher compared with bupivacaine. In awake sheep, for example, almost 78% more levobupivacaine was required to cause death. In contrast, in anaesthetised dogs no differences were seen in the incidence of spontaneous or electrical stimulation- induced ventricular tachycardia and fibrillations among animals exposed to levobupivacaine or bupivacaine. The reversibility of levobupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity has also been assessed. Some data point to an advantage of levobupivacaine over bupivacaine but this potential advantage was not confirmed in a recent study in anaesthetised dogs. Three clinical studies have been conducted using surrogate markers of both cardiac and CNS toxicity. In these studies levobupivacaine or bupivacaine were given by intravascular injection to healthy volunteers. Levobupivacaine was found to cause smaller changes in indices of cardiac contractility and the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and also to have less depressant effect on the electroencephalogram. Assuming that levobupivacaine has the same local anaesthetic potency as bupivacaine, then, all things being equal, it is difficult to argue that levobupivacaine should not displace bupivacaine as the long-acting local anaesthetic of choice. It would appear, however, that levobupivacaine has not yet significantly displaced bupivacaine from the markets in which it is sold. This may be due to a lack of perceived safety benefit and/or consideration of the additional costs that are associated with switching to levobupivacaine, which is approximately 57% more expensive than bupivacaine. If the price of levobupivacaine were closer to bupivacaine then the argument to switch to levobupivacaine would undoubtedly be much stronger. With the continued clinical use of levobupivacaine the database available to make comparisons will increase and this may allow cost-benefit arguments to be made more forcefully for levobupivacaine in the future."
False,established dmards sulfasalazine hydroxychloroquine also demonstrated efficacy used together methotrexatenan,11304108,hydroxychloroquine,DMARDs,"Because of radiographic evidence of progressive bone loss and the inability to eliminate synovial proliferation with methotrexate, it became apparent that therapy for rheumatoid arthritis needed further advancement. Methotrexate is not a remission-inducing drug and may have dose-limiting toxicity. In the past 2 years, three new disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been approved: leflunomide, etanercept, and infliximab. Each of these agents has demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo in randomized, controlled studies. Because methotrexate had a dominant therapeutic role, the new drugs were also studied in combination with it. Other established DMARDs, such as sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine, have also demonstrated efficacy when used together with methotrexate. The results of these combination studies clearly demonstrate that clinical responses can be meaningfully improved when new and existing DMARDs are added to methotrexate. Although toxicity remains a serious concern when powerful immune modulators and antimetabolites are used in combination, relatively few serious adverse events have been reported during 2-year treatment periods. It has also become apparent that combinations of new DMARDs and methotrexate virtually halt radiographic progression over 2 years. The new agents are expensive, but annual costs must be weighed against the personal and societal expense of joint arthroplasty, hospitalizations, disability, and diminished quality of life that accompanies poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. The ultimate value of combination DMARD therapy with methotrexate will be determined by long-term data on safety, efficacy, and effects on radiographic deterioration of bone. Additional long-term observational data on the incidence of joint arthroplasty and disability will help to place the issue of societal costs in a better perspective. This will allow the value of aggressive treatment to be established with certainty."
True,induction adrp tg accumulation also observed oleic acid treated huh human liver cellsnan,16230742,oleic acid,ADRP,"Adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) is a major protein associated with lipid droplets in various types of cells, including macrophage-derived foam cells and liver cells. However, the role of ADRP in the processes of formation and regression of these cells is not understood. When J774 murine macrophages were incubated with either VLDL or oleic acid, their content of both ADRP and triacylglycerol (TG) increased 3- to 4-fold. Induction of ADRP during TG accumulation was also observed in oleic acid-treated HuH-7 human liver cells. Addition of triacsin C, a potent inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthase, for 6 h decreased the amount of TG in VLDL-induced foam cells and oleic acid-treated liver cells; it decreased the amount of ADRP protein in parallel, indicating the amount of ADRP reduced during regression of the lipid-storing cells. Addition of a proteasome inhibitor during triacsin C treatment abolished the ADRP decrease and accumulated polyubiquitinated ADRP. In addition, the proteasome inhibitor reversed not only the degradation of ADRP but also TG reduction by triacsin C. These results suggest that cellular amounts of ADRP and TG regulate each other and that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in degradation of ADRP during regression of lipid-storing cells."

After 3 weeks of treatment, tumor size significantly decreased to allow for a safe surgical resection with clear margins. We believe that further study of sunitinib and octreotide with the neoadjuvant intent of preparing tumors for resection is warranted as a strategy to improve curative management of neuroendocrine tumors."

True,tacrolimus toxicity due drug interaction mibefradil patient liver transplantationnan,10549098,Tacrolimus,Tacrolimus toxicity,"A 54-year-old male liver transplant patient received mibefradil, a novel T-type calcium channel blocker, as antihypertensive treatment while he was on tacrolimus. He subsequently developed dizziness and fatigue of gradual onset as well as shoulder muscle ache. In addition, reversible impairment of renal function occurred with an increase in creatinine and potassium levels. Monitoring of tacrolimus levels, which had been in the desired range (5-8 ng/ml) until recently, revealed an increase to toxic level of 54 ng/ml. After discontinuation of mibefradil, tacrolimus levels returned to the normal range and all symptoms and clinical changes were reversible. Mibefradil and tacrolimus both are metabolized through the cytochrome--P-450 pathway. We suspect that drug interaction due to competitive inhibition of tacrolimus metabolism by mibefradil was responsible for these toxic effects. Therefore, special caution is recommended when administering tacrolimus with other drugs that carry the potential for pharmakokinetic interaction."
False,seven patients localized disease stage iii six surviving patients received chemotherapy vincristine actinomycin patient received radiotherapynan,10212915,vincristine,localized disease,"Bilateral Wilms' tumor occurs at a younger age than unilateral disease. While it generally has a good prognosis, it presents a therapeutic dilemma to balance curative surgical resection with preservation of renal tissue. A 15 year review of bilateral Wilms' tumors diagnosed at Princess Margaret Hospital was undertaken. Of 46 Wilms' tumor cases, eight were designated bilateral by diagnostic imaging (median age 1.1 years compared with 3.5 years for unilateral tumors). The surgical management entailed primary nephrectomy with contralateral biopsy in two patients, and bilateral biopsy and delayed resection in all remaining surviving patients (one patient died of perioperative complications). Seven patients had localized disease (stage I/II) and the six surviving patients received chemotherapy with vincristine and actinomycin; no patient received radiotherapy. All are alive and well (median follow-up 5.1 years). The remaining patient presented with pulmonary metastases and died of disease progression. Pathologic review revealed that four patients had truly bilateral disease demonstrable by histology, three had unilateral Wilms' tumor with contralateral nephrogenic rests, and in one patient the biopsies of the contralateral kidney showed neither tumor nor nephrogenic rests. In most cases pathological material was subject to external review. Follow-up demonstrates excellent renal function with compensatory hypertrophy in the remaining renal tissue. Conservative surgery and simple out-patient based, low toxicity chemotherapy is curative in most patients."
False,twelve postmenopausal women suffering advanced breast cancer plasma estrogens androgens cortisol gonadotropins determined therapy treatment megestrol acetate oral doses escalated  mgnan,9816328,estrogens,breast cancer,"Twelve postmenopausal women suffering from advanced breast cancer had plasma estrogens, androgens, cortisol, and gonadotropins determined before therapy and during treatment with megestrol acetate (MA) in oral doses escalated from 40 to 160 mg. The plasma clearance and production rate of estrone and estrone sulfate were determined before treatment and after 4 weeks of therapy with 160 mg MA. Treatment with MA suppressed plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, and cortisol in a dose-dependent manner to <10% of pretreatment values. Plasma testosterone, estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate were suppressed to 18-29% of pretreatment values, whereas the gonadotropins were suppressed to 35-52%. The plasma clearance rates of estrone and estrone sulfate were increased by a mean value of 23.7% (P < 0.01) and 23.5% (P < 0.025), whereas the production rates were reduced by 76.7% (P < 0.0005) and 76.1% (P < 0.0005), respectively. Our findings indicate that MA causes profound suppression of adrenal steroid production but in addition suppresses ovarian secretion of androgens in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. The reduction in plasma estrogens is comparable to values obtained with commonly used aromatase inhibitors and may be responsible for its antitumor effects in breast cancer."
False,study examined effect magnesium supplementation muscle magnesium content running performance km marathon footrace muscle damage rate recovery muscle function following racenan,1299490,magnesium,muscle damage,"This study examined the effect of magnesium supplementation on muscle magnesium content, on running performance during a 42-km marathon footrace, and on muscle damage and the rate of recovery of muscle function following the race. Twenty athletes were divided equally into two matched groups and were studied for 4 weeks before and 6 weeks after a marathon in a double-blind trial; the experimental group received magnesium supplement (365 mg per day) and the control group, placebo. Magnesium supplementation did not increase either muscle or serum magnesium concentrations and had no measurable effect on 42-km marathon running performance. Extra magnesium ingestion also had no influence on the extent of muscle damage or the rate of recovery of muscle function. The latter was significantly reduced immediately after the marathon but returned to normal within 1 week. Thus, magnesium supplementation in magnesium-replete subjects did not enhance performance or increase resistance to muscle damage during the race, or the rate of recovery of muscle function following the race."

True,adhesion lung metastasis human melanoma cells nodscid mice also potentiated cotreatment 12(s)-hete nan,23664097,12(S)-HETE,metastasis,"12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) is a non-haeme iron-containing dioxygenase that forms 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) or 15(S)-HETE. Several biological mediators including cytokines, growth factors and lipid metabolites released during tumour cell-endothelial cell adhesion are associated with malignant tumour progression. Here we found that HETEs released from the host organ played a critical role in tumour metastasis. Intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma cells caused lung nodule formation, which was markedly attenuated in 12/15-LOX null mice. Co-injection of melanoma cells with 12(S)-HETE increased the lung homing activity of B16F10 melanoma cells. In vitro studies showed that 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent increase of adhesion of B16F10 cells on collagen or fibronectin. The melanoma cell adhesion was then evaluated in pulmonary primary cell culture isolated from wild-type (WT) and 12/15-LOX knockout (KO) mice. It was found that the adhesion of melanoma cells on the epithelial cells isolated from 12/15-LOX null mice was reduced in comparison with those isolated from WT mice. Treatment of 12(S)-HETE increased the pFAK in melanoma cells adhering on collagen-coated slide. The enhancement of adherence elicited by 12(S)-HETE in B16F10 cells could be antagonised by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor 14 (FAK inhibitor) or PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor). 12(S)-HETE increased the phosphorylation of FAK and ERK in adhering melanoma cells. The FAK phosphorylation induced by 12(S)-HETE was further inhibited by PD98059, indicating that FAK is the downstream target of ERK. The adhesion and lung metastasis of human melanoma cells of C32 in NOD/SCID mice were also potentiated by co-treatment with 12(S)-HETE. These results demonstrate that 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE activates ERK and FAK signalling pathways, thereby upregulates the adhesion and metastatic potential of melanoma cells. The endogenous release of 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE in the host organ may affect the metastatic potential of melanoma. "
True,anovulatory cycles may prolonged oestrogen stimulation endometrium without progesterone withdrawal cycles irregular bleeding may heavynan,22972055,oestrogen,bleeding,"Irregular menstrual bleeding may arise due to exogenous sex steroids, lesions of the genital tract or be associated with anovulation. Irregular bleeding due to oligo/anovulation (previously called dysfunctional uterine bleeding or DUB) is more common at the extremes of reproductive life, and in women with ovulatory disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In anovulatory cycles there may be prolonged oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium without progesterone withdrawal and so cycles are irregular and bleeding may be heavy. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle, in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination, are widely used in the management of irregular menstrual bleeding, but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used vary widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach."

Liver functions deteriorated 1 to 2 wk after withdrawal of the steroid therapy and liver failure occurred. Steroid readministration and intensive therapy for liver failure did not prevent death. An excessive immune response provoked by steroid withdrawal and decreased reserve capacity due to underlying chronic liver disease were thought to be factors in the liver failure. Caution must be exercised in the administration of steroids to patients with underlying chronic HBV infection to prevent exacerbation of hepatitis. Prompt readministration of steroids is indicated if evidence of liver failure develops.

True,penicillamine induced rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis patient rheumatoid arthritisnan,8267029,Penicillamine,glomerulonephritis,"A 67-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis presented rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) after 5 months of D-penicillamine (250 mg/day) treatment. Light microscopy study showed severe glomerulonephritis with crescent formation in 60% of the glomeruli and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the wall of an arteriole. Immunofluorescence revealed scanty granular IgG, IgA and C3 deposits along the capillary walls and mesangium. The patient was treated with steroid pulse, plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide and antiplatelet agents. A complete recovery of renal function was achieved in a few weeks. This new case of RPGN in the course of D-penicillamine treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and proteinuria in these patients. The prompt discontinuation of D-penicillamine and vigorous treatment measures could allow for a good prognosis as in this case."
False,investigate effect guanethidine pretreatment thermal hyperalgesia experimental sites sensitized heat topical application capsaicinnan,11474550,guanethidine,thermal hyperalgesia,"Supersensitivity to noradrenaline contributes to certain vascular disorders (e.g., hypertension) and chronic neuropathic pain conditions (e.g., complex regional pain syndrome). We aimed to develop a procedure for inducing adrenergic supersensitivity that could be used to investigate the role of catecholamines in these clinical conditions. In the first study, three doses of guanethidine were administered by iontophoresis to separate small patches of skin in the forearm of healthy human volunteers. Four to five hours later. the vasoconstrictor response to the adrenergic releasing agent tyramine was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by iontophoretic pretreatment with guanethidine, indicating that guanethidine had depleted endogenous adrenergic stores. In a second study, guanethidine and saline were administered by iontophoresis four times over approximately 2 weeks at separate sites in the forearm. One to two days after the final pretreatment, vasoconstriction to the iontophoresis of a weak dose of noradrenaline was enhanced at sites pretreated with guanethidine. To investigate the effect of guanethidine pretreatment on thermal hyperalgesia. the experimental sites were sensitized to heat by the topical application of 0.6% capsaicin. Both before and after the application of capsaicin, the heat-pain threshold and heat-pain ratings to suprathreshold stimulation were similar at sites pretreated for 2 weeks with guanethidine or saline. However, after the iontophoresis of noradrenaline, thermal hyperalgesia was greater at the guanethidine-pretreated site than the saline pretreated site. These observations indicate that prolonged depletion of adrenergic stores by guanethidine induces adrenergic supersensitivity in cutaneous vessels, and that adrenergic supersensitivity enhances thermal hyperalgesia in the presence of noradrenaline."

The hypoxia-activated pro-drug TH-302 may have selective toxicity for hypoxic and neighboring cells in tumors. Here we characterize the spatial distribution and ability of TH-302 to selectively target hypoxic regions and complement the effect of doxorubicin and docetaxel by modifying biomarker distribution. Athymic nude mice bearing human breast MCF-7 or prostate PC-3 tumors were treated with doxorubicin or docetaxel respectively and TH-302 alone or in combination. Biomarkers of drug effect including γH2aX (a marker of DNA damage), cleaved caspase-3 or -6 (markers of apoptosis) and reduction in Ki-67 (a marker of cell proliferation) were quantified in tumor sections in relation to functional blood vessels (recognized by DiOC7) and hypoxia (recognized by EF5) using immunohistochemistry. γH2aX expression at 10 min and cleaved caspase-3 or -6 at 24 hr after doxorubicin or docetaxel decreased with increasing distance from tumor blood vessels, with minimal expression in hypoxic regions; maximum reduction in Ki67 levels was observed in regions closest to vasculature at 24 hr. TH-302 induced maximal cell damage in hypoxic and neighboring regions, but was also active in tumor regions closer to blood vessels. TH-302 given 4 hr before doxorubicin or docetaxel increased DNA damage and apoptosis throughout the tumor compared to chemotherapy alone. When given with doxorubicin or docetaxel, TH-302 complements and enhances anticancer effects in both perivascular and hypoxic regions but also increases toxicity."

False,demonstrate molecular mechanism inhibitory action apigenin androgenrefractory human prostate carcinoma du cells mutations tumor suppressor gene prbnan,14750216,apigenin,prostate carcinoma,"Development of effective agents for treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer has become a national medical priority. We have reported recently that apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone), found in many common fruits and vegetables, has shown remarkable effects in inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis in many human prostate carcinoma cells. Here we demonstrate the molecular mechanism of inhibitory action of apigenin on androgen-refractory human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells that have mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 and pRb. Treatment of cells with apigenin resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of growth, colony formation, and G1 phase arrest of the cell cycle. This effect was associated with a marked decrease in the protein expression of cyclin D1, D2, and E and their activating partner, cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)2, 4, and 6, with concomitant upregulation of WAF1/p21, KIP1/p27, INK4a/p16, and INK4c/p18. The induction of WAF1/p21 and its growth inhibitory effects by apigenin appears to be independent of p53 and pRb status of these cells. Apigenin treatment also resulted in alteration in Bax/Bcl2 ratio in favor of apoptosis, which was associated with the release of cytochrome c and induction of apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1). This effect was found to result in a significant increase in cleaved fragments of caspase-9, -3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Further, apigenin treatment resulted in downmodulation of the constitutive expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)/p65 and NF-kappaB/p50 in the nuclear fraction that correlated with an increase in the expression of IkappaB-alpha (IkappaBalpha) in the cytosol. Taken together, we concluded that molecular mechanisms during apigenin-mediated growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in DU145 cells was due to (1) modulation in cell-cycle machinery, (2) disruption of mitochondrial function, and (3) NF-kappaB inhibition."

A 43-year-old woman had severe jaundice and itching 1 month after receiving methimazole (10 mg tid) and propranolol (20 mg tid) for treatment of hyperthyroidism. The patient continued treatment for another 4 days after the appearance of jaundice until she finished both medications. When seen at the emergency department 2 weeks later, she still had severe icterus, pruritus, and hyperbilirubinemia, formed mainly of the conjugated fraction. Methimazole-induced cholestasis was diagnosed, and propranolol therapy was resumed. Over the following 9 days, the symptoms improved and plasma bilirubin levels were normal after 12 weeks without methimazole. In rare cases within the first few weeks of therapy, this drug can cause severe and reversible cholestatic jaundice. Physicians and patients should be aware of this adverse effect so that, upon occurrence, they can discontinue methimazole therapy and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures."
True,"thus response pentostatin correlates induction oas directly 2',5'-oligoadenylate system seems involved cytotoxicity nan",1564958,pentostatin,cytotoxicity,"Similar to interferon alpha, pentostatin is highly effective in hairy cell leukemia and moderately active in other chronic lymphoid malignancies. In ten patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and seven patients with other B-cell chronic leukemias (BCL), we have studied the intracellular 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2,5OAS) activity of the mononuclear cells before, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after pentostatin administration. In patients with HCL the median level of intracellular 2,5OAS increased 4.6-fold at 4 h and 11.5-fold at 24 h compared to the pretreatment value. Among the other seven patients, the median intracellular 2,5OAS remained unchanged in three patients and rose slightly by 2 to 14 times in four patients. Eleven patients (eight with HCL and two with BCL) responded to pentostatin. The median increase in 2,5OAS among the responders was 13.0-fold (range 4.8-30.0) whereas that among non-responders was 2.2-fold (range 0.2-6.3). The difference was highly significant (p less than 0.0001). In five of the total seventeen patients, the plasma levels of 2,5OAS activity were also determined and changes in plasma levels paralleled those measured intracellularly. To determine if the elevation of 2,5OAS is mediated by induction of interferon alpha, the expressions of mRNA for interferon alpha and beta were investigated by means of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction using the corresponding sense primers. In none of the five patients thus studied could we find an induction of mRNA for interferon alpha or beta in the leukemic cells during treatment with pentostatin. Thus, response to pentostatin correlates with induction of 2,5OAS directly and the 2',5'-oligoadenylate system seems to be involved in cytotoxicity."

Prolongation of QT interval, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents, but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem, an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for hypertension. The patient was in near syncope and had QT-interval prolongation. After discontinuing cisapride, the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur. We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, including diltiazem."
False,glucose proved nitrogen sparing properties postoperative patients critically ill patients tolerate glucose loads poorly fat appears obligatory fuel sepsis nan,1740940,glucose,sepsis,"The ideal energy substrate for critically ill patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) remains controversial. While glucose has been proved to have nitrogen sparing properties in postoperative patients, critically ill patients tolerate glucose loads poorly and fat appears to be an obligatory fuel in sepsis. Furthermore, it is not yet certain whether the changes in whole body protein metabolism induced by critical illness are influenced by the nature of the TPN provided. This study was conducted on patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) who fulfilled the criteria of requiring TPN and mechanical ventilation for at least four days. Patients were randomized to receive either glucose (G) or equicaloric proportions of glucose and lipid (GF) as an intravenous energy source. TPN was commenced early, within 24-48 hr of trauma or surgery and admission to the ICU. Nonprotein calorie intake was 125% of calculated basal energy expenditure. Nitrogen balance was calculated from 24-hr urinary urea excretion. Protein synthesis, turnover, and catabolism were measured on Day 4 of the study using an established radiolabeled C14-leucine technique. Degree of sepsis and illness were calculated using published scores. Fifty patients entered the trial but 32 were excluded by Day 4. Of the 18 patients completing an initial four day study, eight went on to complete a second study on the alternative regimen--a total of 26 studies (14 G, 12 GF). Net protein synthesis was achieved in 18 studies (12 G, 6 FG) and positive nitrogen balance by Day 4 in 22 studies. Four patients on the G regimen were withdrawn due to glucose intolerance while none of the patients on GF developed glucose intolerance or hyperlipidaemia. Both whole body protein synthesis and catabolism correlated significantly with degree of sepsis. The type of TPN fuel used, G and GF, did not appear to influence whole body protein dynamics, both regimens achieving greatly improved whole body protein kinetics."

We aimed to find out whether dietary manipulation can correct the hyperlipidaemia found in these patients. After a baseline control period of 8 weeks on their usual diets, 20 untreated patients with chronic glomerular diseases, stable long-lasting severe proteinuria (5.9 [SD 3.4] g/24 h) and hyperlipidaemia (mean serum cholesterol 8.69 [3.34] mmol/l) ate a vegetarian soy diet for 8 weeks. The diet was low in fat (28% of total calories) and protein (0.71 [0.36] g/kg ideal body weight daily), cholesterol free, and rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated/saturated ratio 2.5) and in fibre (40 g/day). After the diet period the patients resumed their usual diets for 8 weeks (washout period). During the soy-diet period there were significant falls in serum cholesterol (total, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein) and apolipoproteins A and B, but serum triglyceride concentrations did not change. Urinary protein excretion fell significantly. The concentrations of all lipid fractions and the amount of proteinuria tended to return towards baseline values during the washout period. We do not know whether the favourable effect of this dietary manipulation on proteinuria was due to the qualitative or quantitative modifications of dietary protein intake or was a direct consequence of the manipulation of dietary lipid intake."

Methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), and cyclosporine (CsA) are the most widely used DMARDs in the treatment of PsA and are safe and effective in patients with active peripheral arthritis, although they do not appear to be effective on axial manifestations. No controlled study has evaluated the efficacy of these drugs on the progression of radiological damage. It has recently been demonstrated that leflunomide and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are effective in PsA and psoriasis. The symptomatic improvement has been important and sustained and side effects minimal. In particular, inhibitors of TNF appear to have excellent potential to treat PsA. These agents are able to slow joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis and they are effective on spinal symptoms in ankylosing spondylitis. Hopefully, these findings will prove true in PsA as well."

False,increased oxidative stress due excess freeradical activity may central diabetic vascular disease endothelial cell damage lipoprotein oxidation modification platelet reactivity arachidonic acid cascade properties free radicals reaction products lipid peroxidesnan,7833498,arachidonic acid,diabetic vascular disease,"Patients with type II diabetes commonly die from thrombotic vascular disease. Large vessel occlusion due to thrombosis or atherosclerotic stenosis is a process accelerated by diabetes and results in premature death. Diabetic small vessel disease, with its unique microangiopathic process, underlies many of the large vessel changes as well as causing retinopathy and nephropathy. The microangiopathic changes produce a prothrombotic tendency that has been widely reported in type II diabetes. There is reduced endothelial cell production of prostacyclin and the activators of fibrinolysis, together with increased platelet reactivity. In addition, there is increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress due to excess free-radical activity and impaired antioxidant defenses particularly in the presence of microvascular disease. The development of many of these abnormalities is associated with poor long-term glycemic control. However, the changes are also seen in atherosclerosis in nondiabetic patients where the progression of the disease can be modified by antiplatelet agents and antioxidants. The process of vascular damage is accelerated by diabetes, often due to co-existing disease and aging, although it is not clear that improvement in long-term glycemic control by lowering blood glucose levels to near to the nondiabetic state reduces the development of small and large vessel disease. Although the biochemical mechanism underlying this observation remains uncertain, protein glycosylation and increased platelet reactivity are implicated and interrelated. Increased oxidative stress due to excess free-radical activity may be central to diabetic vascular disease as endothelial cell damage, lipoprotein oxidation, modification of both platelet reactivity and arachidonic acid cascade are all properties of free radicals and their reaction products lipid peroxides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Preliminary in vitro antibacterial activity of the NHC-precursors and NHC-silver complexes was investigated against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli using the qualitative Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion method. NHC-silver complexes have shown very high antibacterial activity compared to the NHC-precursors. All six NHC-silver complexes were tested for their cytotoxicity through MTT based in vitro tests on the human renal-cancer cell line Caki-1 in order to determine their IC₅₀ values. NHC-silver complexes 4a-f were found to have IC₅₀ values of 6.2 (±1.0), 7.7 (±1.6), 1.2 (±0.6), 10.8 (±1.9), 24.2 (±1.8) and 13.6 (±1.0) μM, respectively. These values represent improved cytotoxicity against Caki-1, most notably for 4c, which is a three times more cytotoxic than cisplatin (IC₅₀ value = 3.3 μM) itself."

False,using svm several known hcc inhibitors geldanamycin alvespimycin hsp inhibitors doxorubicin chemotherapy drug predictednan,23220021,doxorubicin,HCC,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a severe liver malignancy with few drug treatment options. In finding an effective treatment for HCC, screening drugs that are already FDA-approved will fast track the clinical trial and drug approval process. Connectivity Map (CMap), a large repository of chemical-induced gene expression profiles, provides the opportunity to analyze drug properties on the basis of gene expression. Support Vector Machines (SVM) were utilized to classify the effectiveness of drugs against HCC using gene expression profiles in CMap. The results of this classification will help us (1) identify genes that are chemically sensitive, and (2) predict the effectiveness of remaining chemicals in CMap in the treatment of HCC and provide a prioritized list of possible HCC drugs for biological verification. Four HCC cell lines were treated with 146 distinct chemicals, and cell viability was examined. SVM successfully classified the effectiveness of the chemicals with an average Area Under ROC Curve (AUROC) of 0.9. Using reported HCC patient samples, we identified chemically sensitive genes that may be possible HCC therapeutic targets, including MT1E, MYC, and GADD45B. Using SVM, several known HCC inhibitors, such as geldanamycin, alvespimycin (HSP90 inhibitors), and doxorubicin (chemotherapy drug), were predicted. Seven out of the 23 predicted drugs were cardiac glycosides, suggesting a link between this drug category and HCC inhibition. The study demonstrates a strategy of in silico drug screening with SVM using a large repository of microarrays based on initial in vitro drug screening. Verifying these results biologically would help develop a more accurate chemical sensitivity model."

After 3 weeks of treatment, tumor size significantly decreased to allow for a safe surgical resection with clear margins. We believe that further study of sunitinib and octreotide with the neoadjuvant intent of preparing tumors for resection is warranted as a strategy to improve curative management of neuroendocrine tumors."
False,den pb treated rats survival prolonged tumor incidence decreased compared results obtained den alonenan,3780814,DEN,tumor,"The present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of phenobarbital (PB: 15 mg per rat of ingested dose) on carcinogenesis when it is administered simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine (DEN: 10 mg/kg/day). Wistar rats (180 g) were treated by DEN alone or by DEN + PB during 2, 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis. After the end of the treatment, the number and the size of induced PAS positive preneoplastic foci was significantly reduced when PB was given simultaneously with DEN for 4 and 6 weeks. The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in DEN treated rats were also significantly decreased in DEN + PB treated rats. When the treatment last only 2 weeks, the presence of PB did not change significantly the last parameters. In DEN + PB treated rats, the survival was prolonged and the tumor incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by DEN alone. It is concluded that PB, which promotes carcinogenesis when administered after the DEN treatment, reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with DEN. This 'anti-carcinogen' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the precancerous lesions. Biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this 'paradoxical' PB effect."
True,erb alleviated tactile hyperalgesia induced capsaicin reversed tactile allodynia caused spinal nerve ligation various chemical insultsnan,18559275,capsaicin,tactile hyperalgesia/allodynia,"The effects of estrogens on pain perception remain controversial. In animal models, both beneficial and detrimental effects of non-selective estrogens have been reported. ERb-131 a non-steroidal estrogen receptor beta ligand was evaluated in several pain animal models involving nerve injury or sensitization. Using functional and binding assays, ERb-131 was characterized as a potent and selective estrogen receptor beta agonist. In vivo, ERb-131 was devoid of estrogen receptor alpha activity as assessed in a rat uterotrophic assay. ERb-131 alleviated tactile hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin, and reversed tactile allodynia caused by spinal nerve ligation and various chemical insults. Moreover, ERb-131 did not influence the pain threshold of normal healthy animals. Thus, estrogen receptor beta agonism is a critical effector in attenuating a broad range of anti-nociceptive states."
False,randomized trials determine relative efficacy ifosfamide cyclophosphamide various childhood malignancies waynan,1485174,ifosfamide,malignancies,"This paper reviews current approaches to the use of ifosfamide/mesna alone or in combination with other agents or modalities in the treatment of pediatric malignancies. Included are data from current or recently completed studies conducted by major pediatric oncology cooperative groups and large individual oncology centers for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent tumors. Sarcomas, neuroblastoma, lymphomas, recurrent solid tumors, brain tumors, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia are discussed. Randomized trials to determine the relative efficacy of ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide in various childhood malignancies are under way. The long-term consequences of ifosfamide in survivors of childhood cancer, in terms of development of bladder cancer or other malignancies thought to be associated with alkylating agents, are not known, and will only be determined through follow-up studies of adult survivors. Ifosfamide's future role in pediatric oncology will depend on evaluation of its therapeutic benefits against long-term toxicity."

Based on empirical drug limitations about 10-15% of patients will develop congestive heart failure (CHF) with a mortality of -50% within 2 years on digitalo-diuretic therapy alone. To avoid CHF there is a consensus recommendation that cardiac function should be monitored in close connection with anthracycline administration. As no prospective studies in a larger series have been performed, these recommendations are based on retrospective data on small numbers of patients."

Patients were randomized to receive pravastatin 10 mg or matching placebo with doubling of the dose after 8 weeks if predefined target levels for total cholesterol [(i.e., < 5.2 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) or > 15% decrease from baseline] had not been achieved. At Week 16, pravastatin-treated patients showed a 21.4% decrease in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a 13.5% reduction in serum total cholesterol (TC) concentrations (p < 0.001 compared with placebo). Levels of triglycerides (TG) were reduced 9.6% during pravastatin treatment (p < 0.05 compared with placebo) while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were increased 4.4% (p = NS). Adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities were similar among patients treated with pravastatin or placebo. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels remained unchanged. The results of this study demonstrate that low-dose pravastatin is effective and well tolerated for lowering elevated cholesterol concentrations during short-term treatment of patients with NIDDM and hypercholesterolemia."

The newer combination of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) has demonstrated comparable survival and an improved toxicity profile (Von der Maase et al. 2000). At present, the importance to patients of the toxicity of chemotherapy has not been widely studied. An earlier study in bladder cancer indicated that toxicity was an important determinant of treatment preference (Davey et al. 2000). A study of preferences for advanced bladder cancer therapy in the UK was proposed."

Prolongation of QT interval, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents, but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem, an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for hypertension. The patient was in near syncope and had QT-interval prolongation. After discontinuing cisapride, the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur. We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, including diltiazem."
False,normal healthy individuals found excrete  nmol 8ohdg   mumol 8ohdg per mol creatinine urine whereas increased levels 8ohdg found collections variety cancer patients samples taken onset oncological therapy  mumolmol creatininenan,7646926,8OHdG,cancer,"An automated analytical method has been developed for determination of the oxidative DNA adduct, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHdG) in human urine, based on coupled-column high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Urine is concentrated on Bondelut CH by means of an automated sample processor, and the enriched sample injected on to a polymeric reversed phase column coupled in line with an electrochemical detector and a C18 reversed phase column. By use of the electrochemical detector, a suitable retention time interval is set for collection of the fraction containing 8OHdG from the chromatography on the first column; this fraction is collected in a 2 mL loop and injected onto the C18 column. The system is operated by an automatic valve station controlled by an integrator. The method has a large sample capacity and measures 31.1, 15.7, and 7.43 nmol 8OHdG/L urine with variation coefficients of 8, 8 and 24% within series and 8, 11 and 23% between series. Normal healthy individuals were found to excrete 14.9 +/- 7.8 nmol 8OHdG/24 h, or 1.11 +/- 0.62 mumol 8OHdG per mol creatinine, in their urine, whereas increased levels of 8OHdG were found in 24 h collections from a variety of cancer patients, both in samples taken before onset of oncological therapy (1.84 +/- 1.12 mumol/mol creatinine, P < 0.01 versus healthy individuals) and after therapy onset (2.18 +/- 1.44 mumol/mol creatinine, P < 0.001 versus healthy individuals). Moreover, mean values of 8OHdG in random urinary samples from cancer patients were significantly higher than from healthy individuals (2.42 +/- 2.28 versus 1.19 +/- 0.48 mumol/mol creatinine, P < 0.001), both in samples taken before therapy onset (1.91 +/- 0.96, P < 0.001 versus healthy individuals) and after (2.57 +/- 2.46, P < 0.001 versus healthy individuals). High levels of urinary 8OHdG were found in patients subjected to whole body irradiation, and in patients receiving chemotherapy with various cytostatic agents. The potential use of the method for detecting increased urinary 8OHdG excretion and conditions associated with increased oxidative DNA damage in humans is discussed."
False,mechanism blood glucose lowering effect day low calorie diet vlcd kjd combination cessation blood glucose lowering agents studied  women men obese body mass index  kgm mean sem type diabetic patients age  years hba   undergoing insulin therapynan,15931603,glucose,diabetic,"The mechanism of the blood glucose-lowering effect of a 2-day very low calorie diet (VLCD; 1890 kJ/d) in combination with the cessation of all blood glucose-lowering agents was studied in 12 (7 women, 5 men) obese (body mass index, 36.3 +/- 1.0 kg/m 2 [mean +/- SEM]) type 2 diabetic patients (age, 55 +/- 4 years; HbA 1c , 7.3% +/- 0.4%) undergoing insulin therapy. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) and whole body glucose disposal (6,6 2 H 2 -glucose), lipolysis ( 2 H 5 -glycerol), and substrate oxidation (indirect calorimetry) rates were measured before and after the intervention in basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions. After 2 days of a VLCD and discontinuation of all blood glucose-lowering therapies, fasting plasma glucose levels did not increase (11.3 +/- 1.3 vs 10.3 +/- 1.0 mmol/L). Basal EGP significantly declined (14.2 +/- 1.0 to 11.9 +/- 0.7 mu mol/kg per minute; P = .009). Basal metabolic clearance rate of glucose and rate of basal lipolysis did not change. During hyperinsulinemia, EGP (5.5 +/- 0.8 to 5.2 +/- 0.5 mu mol/kg per minute), whole body glucose disposal (12.1 +/- 0.7 to 11.3 +/- 1.0 mu mol/kg per minute), the metabolic clearance rate of glucose, and the rate of lipolysis did not change after the 2-day intervention. Cessation of blood glucose-lowering therapy in combination with a 2-day VLCD does not lead to hyperglycemia and is associated with a reduction in basal EGP. Insulin-stimulated whole body glucose disposal did not improve, nor did insulin suppressibility of EGP and lipolysis."
True,aspirin intolerant asthma aia occurs asthma exacerbation exposure aspirin nan,20597903,Aspirin,asthma,"Aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) occurs from asthma exacerbation after exposure to aspirin. However, the underlying mechanisms of AIA occurrence are still unclear. The critical role of the solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, betaine/GABA) member 12 (SLC6A12) gene in GABAergic transmission, which is associated with mucus production in asthma, makes it a candidate gene for AIA association study. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLC6A12 were genotyped in 163 aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) and 429 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) patients of Korean ethnicity. Associations between polymorphisms of SLC6A12 and AIA were analysed using multivariate logistic analysis. Results showed that two polymorphisms and a haplotype in SLC6A12, rs499368 (P= 0.005; P(corr)= 0.03), rs557881 (non-synonymous C10R, P= 0.007; P(corr)= 0.04), and SLC6A12_BL1_ht1 (P= 0.009; P(corr)= 0.05) respectively, were significantly associated with AIA after multiple testing corrections. In addition, SNPs of SLC6A12 were significantly associated with the fall rate of FEV(1) by aspirin provocation suggesting that SLC6A12 could affect reversibility of lung function abnormalities in AIA patients. Although these results are preliminary and future replications are needed to confirm these findings, this study showed evidence of association between variants in SLC6A12 and AIA occurrence among asthmatics in a Korean population."
False,experiments using human fibrosarcoma ht respiratorydeficient cells rho uncoupler mitochondrial respiratory chain mrc showed betatac nbetatac impaired mrc rho cells displayed increased sensitivity toward nbetatac compared rho cells contrast resistant betatac classic chemotherapeutics paclitaxel nan,17332362,paclitaxel,fibrosarcoma,"Chloroethylureas (CEU) are soft alkylating agents that covalently bind to beta-tubulin (betaTAC) and affect microtubule polymerization dynamics. Herein, we report the identification of a CEU subset and its corresponding oxazolines, which induce cell growth inhibition, apoptosis, and microtubule disruption without alkylating beta-tubulin (N-betaTAC). Both betaTAC and N-betaTAC trigger the collapse of mitochondrial potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and modulate reactive oxygen species levels, following activation of intrinsic caspase-8 and caspase-9. Experiments using human fibrosarcoma HT1080 respiratory-deficient cells (rho(0)) and uncoupler of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) showed that betaTAC and N-betaTAC impaired the MRC. rho(0) cells displayed an increased sensitivity toward N-betaTAC as compared with rho(+) cells but, in contrast, were resistant to betaTAC or classic chemotherapeutics, such as paclitaxel. Oxazoline-195 (OXA-195), an N-betaTAC derivative, triggered massive swelling of isolated mitochondria. This effect was insensitive to cyclosporin A and to Bcl-2 addition. In contrast, adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) antagonists, bongkrekic acid or atractyloside, diminished swelling induced by OXA-195. The antiproliferative activities of the N-betaTACs CEU-025 and OXA-152 were markedly decreased in the presence of atractyloside. Conversely, pretreatment with cyclosporin A enhanced growth inhibition induced by betaTAC and N-betaTAC. One of the proteins alkylated by N-betaTAC was identified as the voltage-dependent anion channel isoform-1, an ANT partner. Our results suggest that betaTAC and N-betaTAC, despite their common ability to affect the microtubule network, trigger different cytotoxic mechanisms in cancer cells. The role of mitochondria in these mechanisms and the potential of N-betaTAC as a new therapeutic approach for targeting hypoxia-resistant cells are discussed."

We investigated prospectively the arrhythmia incidence in 244 patients with AMI receiving alteplase and a double-blind randomized adjunctive therapy with intravenous atenolol, alinidine, or placebo. Moreover, the characteristics and prognostic significance of early arrhythmias and their relation with infarct size and coronary patency were evaluated."
False,cytotoxicity due exposure ndma partially inhibited antioxidants nacetylcysteine ascorbic acid butylated hydroxyanisole n-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone potentiated upon glutathione depletionnan,9498284,ascorbic acid,cytotoxicity,"GM0637, a human fibroblast cell line, was transfected with pCMV2E1, an expression vector containing the full length cDNA for rat cytochrome P450 2E1 (P450 2E1), and with pCMVneo, which contained vector alone, and the selected clones were designated GM2E1 and GMneo, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that GM2E1, but not GMneo, expressed a protein that reacted with anti-human P450 2E1 antibody. The 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase,p-nitrophenol hydroxylase, and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) demethylase activities of the P450 in these cells were measured in monolayer cell cultures without preparing microsomes. Exposure of the GM2E1 cells to NDMA for 4 days caused severe decreases in cell viability, as determined by crystal violet uptake, and showed a sigmoidal dose-response curve with a median lethal dose of 17 microM. In contrast, the viability of GMneo cells was not altered by NDMA even at concentrations up to 10 mM. Time- and concentration-dependent methylation of DNA, RNA and protein by [14C]NDMA was only observed in cells expressing P450 2E1. Inhibitors of P450 2E1 activity such as ethanol, 4-methylpyrazole, and isoniazid caused a 90% decrease in the methylation of cellular macromolecules and also completely protected the cells against NDMA-mediated toxicity. The cytotoxicity due to exposure to NDMA was partially inhibited by antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole and N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone but was not potentiated upon glutathione depletion. These results document the ability of rat P450 2E1 to metabolize NDMA to toxic reactive intermediates and demonstrate that this cell line provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of metabolism-mediated toxicity and carcinogenesis."
False,high level physical activity expressed training volume experience adversely affect iron stores higher control subjects incidence iron deficiency much lower control groupnan,11183845,iron,iron deficiency,"Iron status was studied in 126 female endurance athletes and 52 control subjects, all aged 16-20 years. The study aimed at identifying factors responsible for iron deficiency. Twenty-six percent of athletes and 50% of controls had latent iron-deficiency without anemia symptoms. A too low intake of iron (especially heme iron: 0.3 mg daily), and of nutrients influencing iron metabolism, were identified as main causes of iron deficiency in control subjects. In athletes, whose iron intake was sufficient (14.6 mg), the principal cause of iron deficiency were blood losses due to menstruation. High level of physical activity, expressed as training volume and experience, did not adversely affect iron stores, as these were higher than in control subjects and the incidence of iron deficiency was much lower than in the control group. It was concluded that an increased intake of iron and of dietary factors involved in iron metabolism prevented possible exercise-induced losses of iron in young athletes."

To clarify the pathogenesis underlying these alterations, in six obese patients (3 males and 3 females, age 20-44 yrs, BMI = 42.1 +/- 2.2) on unrestricted diet we studied the effect of 8 day GHRH pretreatment (1 micrograms/kg iv each day) on the acute somatotropic response to the neurohormone administered both alone and combined with arginine (ARG, 0.5 g/kg iv infused from 0 to 30 min) which likely inhibits the release of hypothalamic somatostatin. Before treatment the GH response to GHRH (AUC: 231.9 +/- 106.4 micrograms/l/h) was potentiated (p < 0.001) by ARG (932.6 +/- 166.2 micrograms/l/h). However, the GH responses to the neurohormone both alone and combined with ARG were lower (p < 0.02 and 0.002, respectively) than in normals (712.4 +/- 111.6 and 2608.3 +/- 453.2 micrograms/l/h, respectively). After repetitive GHRH administration, in obese subjects baseline GH and IGF-I levels were unchanged. Also the GH responses to GHRH both alone (217.3 +/- 68.1 micrograms/l/h) and combined with ARG (756.3 +/- 202.9 micrograms/l/h) were not modified. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the failure of GHRH pretreatment to improve the somatotrope hyporesponsiveness to GHRH both alone and combined with ARG suggesting the existence of a somatotropic defect in obesity."
True,conclusion hiv proteins nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrtis cause axonal damage inducing mitochondrial injury rearrangement microtubulesnan,17505984,nucleoside,mitochondrial injury,"Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) has emerged as the most common complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which is associated with neuronal injury in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, especially nucleoside analogs, patients are living longer. Some of the antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV infection have been associated with neuropathies. The pathogenesis of these neuropathies remains poorly understood. Utilizing a human fetal DRG model of predominantly nociceptive fibers, the authors investigated the effects of HIV gp120 and Tat(1-72), alone or in combination with nucleoside analogs on both morphological and ultra-structural changes in DRG neurons. Nucleoside analogs and HIV proteins both caused a significant decrease in the mean axonal length. However, ddI was the most potent, followed by ddC, d4T, and AZT. Despite the combined exposure to toxic dosages of HIV proteins and nucleoside analogs, there appeared to be a ceiling effect on the amount of axonal retraction, indicating that the proximal and distal axon are differentially regulated. In conclusion, both HIV proteins and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) cause axonal damage by inducing mitochondrial injury and rearrangement of microtubules."

We present herein the first case of SCLE induced by acebutolol. A 57-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of a cutaneous eruption of the photo-exposed areas. One month ago, the patient had started a treatment with oral acebutolol to cure a hypertension of 1-year evolution. Physical examination revealed erythematous scaly annular plaques, involving the face, arms and trunk. Immunologic serology findings revealed a positive titer of antinuclear antibodies up to 1/1,280 with positivity of antihistone and Ro/SSA antibodies. Acebutolol was stopped, and the lesions cleared completely 4 months later. Literature data, along with our case, suggest a link between acebutolol therapy and the onset of a lupus syndrome. Although this is the first report of acebutolol-induced SCLE, we should be aware of this occurrence, and avoidance of acebutolol is recommended in patients with stigmata of lupus erythematosus."

The results obtained did not reveal any subjective or objective pathologic conditions of the ocular apparatus with particular attention to orthoptic examinations, the anterior segment, and the fundus. No patient had changes in visual acuity. Tonometry did not demonstrate significant variations. There were, however, qualitative and quantitative changes in the tear films of all patients, leading to damage to the corneal and conjunctival epithelium."

Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with NMS, atypical antipsychotic drugs like ziprasidone may also be a cause. The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia who developed signs and symptoms of NMS after 2 days of treatment with an 80-mg/day dose of orally administrated ziprasidone. This case is the earliest (second day of treatment) NMS due to ziprasidone reported in the literature."

As reported by Lee et al. (Calcif Tissue Int 86:132-41, 2010), levodopa intake is associated with increased homocysteinemia that is known to be linked to poorer bone quality and, consequently, osteoporotic fractures. Herein, we report the case of a young woman who suffered recurrent metatarsal fractures in the context of levodopa-treated early-onset Parkinson's disease."
False,differences observed heart rate blood pressure gas exchange data time onset claudication peak exercise lactate diphosphoglycerate levelsnan,2172175,lactate,claudication or peak exercise,"Exogenous fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP), a glycolytic intermediate, increases blood ATP and 2,3 diphosphoglycerate levels, facilitates the dissociation of oxygen from hemoglobin, and increases red blood cell flexibility. These mechanisms explain why it has been effective in enhancing energy production in a variety of ischemic conditions. The present study was undertaken to determine whether FDP could enhance oxygen supply and thus improve exercise performance in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Ten male patients (mean age 63 +/- 5 years) with peripheral vascular disease performed symptom-limited exercise testing after randomized, double blind infusion of either 200 mg/kg body weight FDP or placebo. Data were evaluated at rest, at a matched submaximal workload (2-3 MPH/0% grade), and at peak exercise, defined as the occurrence of moderately severe claudication. No differences were observed in heart rate, blood pressure, gas exchange data, time to the onset of claudication or peak exercise, or lactate and 2,3 diphosphoglycerate levels. In contrast to previous studies performed among patients with peripheral vascular disease and other studies using more severe hypoxic conditions, FDP did not affect the respiratory gas exchange or exercise capacity of patients with exertional claudication."
False,hiv infection concurrent methamphetamine abuse results exacerbated neurodegenerative changes rapid progression form subcortical dementia termed hiv associated dementianan,17504172,methamphetamine,HIV-1 infection,"HIV-1 infection with concurrent methamphetamine (MA) abuse results in exacerbated neurodegenerative changes and rapid progression of a form of sub-cortical dementia termed HIV-1 associated dementia (HAD). A notable feature of HAD is the involvement of the dopaminergic system manifested as parkinsonian like movement abnormalities. The HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein is very often used in experimental studies trying to understand neurotoxic consequences of HIV-1 infection, since the pathophysiological changes induced by Tat mirrors, in part, the means by which HIV-1 infection of the nervous system results in neuronal damage. Understanding the interaction of Tat and MA in the basal ganglia and the resultant injury to the dopaminergic system in rodent models as well as cell culture will shed light on the dopaminergic pathology occurring in HIV-1 infected-MA abusers. The aim of this review is to update the reader on the current knowledge of MA and HIV-1 neurotoxicity, specifically Tat, and discuss the progress in understanding how MA synergizes with the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat to damage the basal ganglia."
False,invitro activity azithromycin chlamydia trachomatis infected human endometrial epithelial cells primary transformed cells growing polarized nonpolarized orientation analyzednan,8383102,azithromycin,Chlamydia trachomatis infected,"The in-vitro activity of azithromycin on Chlamydia trachomatis infected human endometrial epithelial cells, both primary and transformed cells growing in a polarized and non-polarized orientation, was analyzed. Addition of azithromycin two hours after adsorption inoculation with continued exposure until 72 h gave an MIC90 and MBC90 of 0.063 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. In addition, the MBC results were more pronounced in infected cells growing in a polarized orientation. Numerous small fluorescent 'spots' (presumed small abnormal inclusions) were visible in the infected cells exposed to MIC concentrations of azithromycin. Immuno-transmission electron microscopy examination revealed intracellular inclusions filled with chlamydial envelope ghosts. Since standard diagnostic antigen detection methods use anti-envelope antibodies, the aberrant envelope-filled inclusions might be interpreted as viable inclusions by fluorescent microscopy and result in high false positive readings.

Drug use evaluation (DUE) is one of the primary tools used to achieve these ends. Fluoroquinolone antimicrobials meet Joint Commission criteria for targeting for DUE: the drugs are used in populations at high risk for adverse drug reactions, quality assurance or infection control committees target them for DUE, the drugs are costly, they may be suspected or known to be used inappropriately, and they are prescribed frequently. Outside this supplement, no published DUE criteria for parenteral fluoroquinolones currently exist. Suggested criteria include use in patients who would otherwise be candidates for oral fluoroquinolone therapy (for which published criteria exist) but who cannot use the oral route of administration due to gastrointestinal conditions predisposing to malabsorption or unavailability of the oral route; for severe infections due to gram-negative pathogens; as a replacement for aminoglycosides when ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity is a substantial risk; targeting to resistant pathogens (i.e., not as empiric therapy); and targeting to therapeutic use only (not for prophylaxis). The DUE process is crucial for ensuring safe, effective, appropriate, and economical drug therapy. It is an effective mechanism for evaluating the use of new agents and as an educational tool for clinicians in the postmarketing period."

False,amlodipine olmesartan combination therapy bedtime administration reduced better mbps correcting nocturnal bp fall improved urinary albumin excretionnan,20828223,amlodipine,MBPS,"Chronotherapy has the potential to improve blood pressure (BP) variability and to decrease stroke and cardiovascular events. The present study examined the efficacy and safety of the bedtime administration in amlodipine-olmesartan combination therapy, as compared with the morning administration. The present study was an open-label, randomized crossover study of the effects of the morning vs. bedtime administration of amlodipine-olmesartan combination. The subject was 31 essential hypertensive patients. Morning BP surge (MBPS) and nocturnal BP pattern were analyzed from ambulatory BP data. Glucose and lipid profiles and cardiovascular-renal data were also collected. The bedtime administration reduced MBPS significantly (24.2 ± 13.5 mmHg vs. 32.3 ± 14.2 mmHg, p < 0.001) with no excessive nocturnal BP fall. In nondipper, the bedtime administration significantly improved nocturnal BP. On the other hand, it did not reduce nocturnal BP in dipper. Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was lower in the bedtime administration than in the morning administration (42.5 ± 59.9 mg/g vs. 75.3 ± 26.4 mg/g, p = 0.044). In amlodipine-olmesartan combination therapy, the bedtime administration reduced better MBPS with correcting nocturnal BP fall and improved urinary albumin excretion. The bedtime dosing of amlodipine and olmesartan seems more apt than the morning dose to obtain the therapeutic goal."

Two recently developed sulfide derivatives of 9-anilinoacridines, 2-({4-[4-(acridin-9-ylamino)phenylthio]phenyl}(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)ethan-1-ol (CK0402) and 3-({4-[4-(acridin-9-ylamino)phenylthio]phenyl}(3-hydroxypropyl)amino)propan-1-ol (CK0403), displayed potent cytotoxic activity in multiple cancer cell lines. In-vitro enzymatic assay demonstrated that CK0402 and CK0403 directly inhibit decatenation reaction of topoisomerase IIalpha. Cells exposed to CK0403 showed DNA fragmentation, and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-2, indicating that it triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis. This was further supported by the fact that cytotoxicity of these drugs is attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of caspases with z-VAD-FMK. Studies with wild-type and p53 primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that p53 does not play a significant role in cell death process initiated by this kind of drug. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1activity moderately enhanced cytotoxic activity of sulfide 9-anilinoacridine, suggesting that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 may have a protective function against 9-anilinoacridine-induced cell death process."

Paracetamol, the most commonly used oral analgesic for paediatric patients, was compared with a new palatable syrup formulation of diclofenac. Sixty-three ASA 1 orA SA 2 children aged one year and above were randomly assigned to receive diclofenac (Group A) or paracetamol (Group B). The study drug was given 30 to 60 minutes before induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with either inhalational sevoflurane or intravenous thiopentone. All subjects received intravenous fentanyl 1 microg/kg(-1) intraoperatively. Postoperative pain was assessed by a blinded observer using the CHEOPS score on eye-opening, and then at 10, 30 and 60 minutes. Children with a CHEOPS score > 7 received further fentanyl 1 microg x kg(-1). The number of cases requiring this ""rescue"" analgesia was recorded. Both groups were comparable in demographics, induction technique, duration of anaesthesia and time between premedication and induction of anaesthesia. Overall, CHEOPS scores were low for both groups at all times and did not differ between the groups at any time. Twenty per cent of the diclofenac group and 27% of the paracetamol group required rescue analgesia (not statistically significant). The efficacy of diclofenac 0.5 mg x kg(-1) and paracetamol 15 mg x kg(-1) as oral analgesic premedication for BMT was comparable in children receiving an anaesthetic which included intraoperative administration of fentanyl 1 microg x kg(-1)."

The studies were done during 30 d of prehypokinesia and 364 d of hypokinesia (HK) periods. Forty endurance-trained volunteers aged 22-26 yr with a peak VO2 max of 66.3 mL.kg-1 min-1 and with an average 15.0 km/d running distance were chosen as subjects. They were equally divided into four groups: 1. Unsupplemented ambulatory control subjects (UACS). 2. Unsupplemented hypokinetic subjects (UHKS). 3. Supplemented hypokinetic subjects (SHKS). 4. Supplemented ambulatory control subjects (SACS). The SHKS and SACS groups took daily 5.0 mg elemental Mg/kg body wt and subjected to Mg loading (10.0 mg Mg/kg body wt). Both the SHKS and UHKS groups were maintained under an average running distance of 4.7 km/d, whereas the SACS and UACS groups did not experience any modifications to their normal training routines and diets. During the prehypokinetic and hypokinetic periods, excretion of Mg in feces and urine, concentration of Mg in serum, and Mg balance were measured. Urinary and serum sodium (Na), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca) were also determined. In both SHKS and UHKS groups, fecal Mg loss, urinary excretion of electrolytes, and serum concentrations of electrolytes increased significantly (p < or = 0.05) when compared with the SACS and UACS groups. During Mg loading tests, urinary and fecal Mg excretion was also greater in the SHKS and UHKS groups than in the SACS and UACS groups. Throughout the study, Mg balance was negative in the SHKS and UHKS groups, whereas in the SACS and UACS groups, Mg balance was positive. It was concluded that significant losses of Mg occurred in the presence of negative Mg balance and Mg deficiency in endurance-trained subjects during prolonged exposure to HK, daily mg supplements, and Mg loading tests. This suggests that Mg is not entering or being retaining by the bones and cells of many tissues where most Mg is deposited normally, resulting in Mg deficiency as was shown by the increased serum Mg concentration."

True,one patients developed cardiac failure mg mmc mg doxorubicinnan,3137399,MMC,cardiac failure,"Since 1975 mitomycin C (MMC) has been suggested to be cardiotoxic, especially when combined with or given following doxorubicin. Data on dose dependency or incidence concerning this side effect were not known. We have initiated a prospective study to obtain some more data on these subjects. Forty-four MMC-treated patients were studied, 37 of them could be evaluated. All patients were studied by repeated physical examinations, chest X-rays, electro- and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) determinations. The results were evaluated per cumulative dose level. One of the patients developed cardiac failure after 30 mg m-2 MMC and only 150 mg m-2 doxorubicin. The cardiac failure was predicted by a drop in EF determined during a cold pressor test. None of the other patients developed clinical cardiotoxicity, nor did the studied parameters change. The literature on this subject was also reviewed. Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature, we suggest that MMC-related cardiotoxicity is dose dependent, occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m-2 or more, mainly in patients also (previously or simultaneously) treated with doxorubicin. The incidence is likely to be less than 10% even for this risk group."

True,environmental impact associated resource depletion human toxicity mainly associated cobalt copper nickel thallium silver whereas ecotoxicity potential primarily associated cobalt copper nickel thallium silvernan,23638841,thallium,toxicity,"Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-polymer (Li-poly) batteries have recently become dominant in consumer electronic products because of advantages associated with energy density and product longevity. However, the small size of these batteries, the high rate of disposal of consumer products in which they are used, and the lack of uniform regulatory policy on their disposal means that lithium batteries may contribute substantially to environmental pollution and adverse human health impacts due to potentially toxic materials. In this research, we used standardized leaching tests, life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and hazard assessment models to evaluate hazardous waste classification, resource depletion potential, and toxicity potentials of lithium batteries used in cellphones. Our results demonstrate that according to U.S. federal regulations, defunct Li-ion batteries are classified hazardous due to their lead (Pb) content (average 6.29 mg/L; σ = 11.1; limit 5). However, according to California regulations, all lithium batteries tested are classified hazardous due to excessive levels of cobalt (average 163,544 mg/kg; σ = 62,897; limit 8000), copper (average 98,694 mg/kg; σ = 28,734; limit 2500), and nickel (average 9525 mg/kg; σ = 11,438; limit 2000). In some of the Li-ion batteries, the leached concentrations of chromium, lead, and thallium exceeded the California regulation limits. The environmental impact associated with resource depletion and human toxicity is mainly associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver, whereas the ecotoxicity potential is primarily associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver. However, the relative contribution of aluminum and lithium to human toxicity and ecotoxicity could not be estimated due to insufficient toxicity data in the models. These findings support the need for stronger government policy at the local, national, and international levels to encourage recovery, recycling, and reuse of lithium battery materials."
True,animal experiments highdose exposure cd induced severe testicular interstitial hemorrhage edema increased incidence fetal death placental necrosis nan,16788562,Cd,necrosis,"Cadmium (Cd) is an industrial and environmental pollutant that exerts adverse effects on a number of organs in humans and animals. Reproductive organs, such as the testis and placenta, are sensitive to the toxic effects of Cd. In animal experiments, high-dose exposure to Cd induced severe testicular interstitial hemorrhage with edema, and increased incidence of fetal death and placental necrosis. Low-dose exposure to Cd affects steroid synthesis in male and female reproductive organs. In 1998, the Ministry of Environment in Japan listed Cd in the strategy plan SPEED98 as one of the chemicals suspected of having possible endocrine disrupting activity. Recently, it has been shown that Cd has potent estrogen- and androgen-like activities in vivo and in vitro, by directly binding to estrogen and androgen receptors. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of Cd as an endocrine disruptor remain to be elucidated. In this review, we will discuss evidence thus far presented concerning the effects of Cd on the endocrine system."

True,patients parkinson's disease pd impulse control disorder icd result dopaminergic medication use particularly dopamine agonists daanan,21604834,dopamine,impulse control disorder/ICD,"Risk-taking behavior is characterized by pursuit of reward in spite of potential negative consequences. Dopamine neurotransmission along the mesocorticolimbic pathway is a potential modulator of risk behavior. In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), impulse control disorder (ICD) can result from dopaminergic medication use, particularly dopamine agonists (DAA). Behaviors associated with ICD include hypersexuality as well as compulsive gambling, shopping, and eating, and these behaviors are potentially linked to alterations to risk processing. Using the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, we assessed the role of agonist therapy on risk-taking behavior in PD patients with (n = 22) and without (n = 19) active ICD symptoms. Patients performed the task both ""on"" and ""off"" DAA. DAA increased risk-taking in PD patients with active ICD symptoms, but it did not affect risk behavior of PD controls. DAA dose was also important in explaining risk behavior. Both groups similarly reduced their risk-taking in high compared to low risk conditions and following the occurrence of a negative consequence, suggesting that ICD patients do not necessarily differ in their abilities to process and adjust to some aspects of negative consequences. Our findings suggest dopaminergic augmentation of risk-taking behavior as a potential contributing mechanism for the emergence of ICD in PD patients."

True,peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors ppars regulate transcription genes involved cholesterol homeostasis thus represent important therapeutic target terms reducing atherosclerosis nan,15136056,cholesterol,atherosclerosis,"Macrophage cholesterol homeostasis is a key process involved in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) regulate the transcription of the genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis and thus represent an important therapeutic target in terms of reducing atherosclerosis. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a potent anti-atherogenic dietary fatty acid in animal models of atherosclerosis and is capable of activating PPARs in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this study examined whether the anti-atherogenic effects of CLA in vivo could be ascribed to altered cholesterol homeostasis in macrophages and macrophage derived foam cells. Of several genes that regulate cholesterol homeostasis investigated, CLA had most effect on the class B scavenger receptor CD36. The cis-9,trans-11 CLA (c9,t11-CLA) and trans-10,cis-12 CLA (t10,c12-CLA) isomers augmented CD36 mRNA expression (P<0.001). Confocal laser microscopy characterised the three-dimensional expression patterns of CD36 in THP-1 macrophages. Linoleic acid, CLA and the PPARgamma ligand rosiglitazone increased discrete cell surface CD36 localisation, with a heterogeneous punctate pattern of expression. In agreement with the observed increases in CD36 mRNA and cell surface expression, intracellular cholesterol concentrations were greater in macrophages exposed to linoleic acid and CLA. Further analysis of cholesterol metabolism showed that CLA had no effect on THP-1 derived foam cell cholesterol efflux to apo AI. Thus, altered cholesterol homeostasis in the macrophage may not explain the anti-atherogenic effects of CLA observed in vivo."
True,two cases delapril group withdrawn study intolerable cough one case manidipine group intolerable dizziness headache nan,11336083,delapril,headache,"This study was designed to investigate the effect of delapril, an ACE inhibitor, and manidipine, a long action calcium antagonist, on persistent microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients. Sixty type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to take delapril 30 mg/day or manidipine 10 mg/day for 48 weeks, in an open label design. Twenty eight of thirty subjects in the delapril group and twenty nine of thirty in the manidipine group completed the study. Urine albumin excretion as measured by the urinary albumin creatinine ratio decreased significantly in both groups (112.0+/-60.9 to 95.3+/-64.9 mg/g and 108.5+/-51.0 to 96.4+/-53.5 mg/g in the delapril and manidipine group respectively, p < 0.05, by paired t-test). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly changed after treatment in the delapril group but significantly decreased in the manidipine group (130.9+/-7.1/80.2+/-6.1 to 127.2+/-7.1/78.0+/-5.3 mm/Hg, p < 0.05, by student's paired t-test). After 48 weeks of treatment, two patients in the delapril group and one patient in the manidipine group converted to normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) and one patient in each group progressed to overt nephropathy (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g). There were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, serum fructosamine, creatinine, potassium and lipid profiles after 48 weeks of treatment in both groups. Two cases in the delapril group were withdrawn during the study because of an intolerable cough and one case in the manidipine group because of intolerable dizziness and headache. In conclusion, both delapril and manidipine are effective in the reduction of microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria."

True,recently vigabatrin induced visual field constriction vfc abnormal ocular electrophysiological studies reportednan,10894216,vigabatrin,visual field constriction/VFC,"Vigabatrin is an anti-epileptic drug particularly useful for drug-resistant partial seizures and infantile spasms. Recently, vigabatrin-induced visual field constriction (VFC) and abnormal ocular electrophysiological studies were reported. In this study, we assessed visual fields, visual evoked potentials (VEPs), and electroretinography (ERG) in children treated with vigabatrin. Twenty-four visually asymptomatic children underwent a clinical ophthalmological examination, perimetry when appropriate, and VEP and ERG. Thirteen patients had at least one abnormal study. VFC was seen in 11 of 17 patients who had perimetry; 5 of 15 patients who underwent VEP testing and 4 of 11 who underwent ERG testing had abnormal examinations. For the most part, abnormal VEPs and ERGs were found in children who also had VFC. There was a consistent trend for longer treatment periods to correlate with VFC, abnormal ERGs, and VEPs. In summary, over half of the children treated with vigabatrin demonstrated VFC or abnormal ocular electrophysiological studies. Perimetry seemed to be the most sensitive modality for identifying vigabatrin toxicity. Abnormal ERGs and VEPs were primarily seen in children with VFC and may be useful in monitoring children who are not appropriate candidates for perimetry. Although the incidence of vigabatrin-induced VFC is worrisome, in the context of intractable seizures or infantile spasms, therapeutic benefits must be weighed against risks."

Audiometry was undertaken at the start of tobramycin treatment, at the end of a 14-day course of treatment, and at follow-up 6 to 8 weeks later. We enrolled 244 patients, of whom 219 (125 children and 94 adults) completed treatment. Nineteen patients were excluded from analysis due to abnormal baseline audiometry. Complete pre- and posttreatment standard audiological data were obtained for 168/219 patients. We found no significant differences in hearing thresholds when they were assessed at the baseline, at the end of treatment, and at follow-up 6 to 8 weeks later were compared. In addition, no significant differences in hearing thresholds were detected between treatment regimens. Similar results were obtained for the subset of 63/168 patients who underwent high-frequency audiometry. We conclude that for a single 14-day course of tobramycin treatment in patients with cystic fibrosis with no preexisiting auditory deficit, no measurable effect on hearing was apparent with either once- or three-times-daily treatment. Estimation of the cumulative cochleotoxic risk in cystic fibrosis patients due to repeated aminoglycoside therapy, as evidenced by the patients excluded from this study due to hearing loss, also requires further characterization."
False,high csa associated elevated ggt probably cholestatic effects explain increased mpag mpa rationan,16359376,MPAG,MPA,"Therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolic acid (MPA) in combination with cyclosporine 2-h concentration (CsA C2, n = 68) or tacrolimus trough concentration (n = 10) was investigated by repeated measurements of MPA and MPA-glucuronide (MPAG) trough concentrations in renal allograft recipients during the first 3 months post-transplant. The acute rejection rate was lower (19% vs. 43%; P < 0.05) in patients achieving CsA C2 target range during the first week (1600-2000 microg/l), n = 26, compared with those who did not, n = 42. Median MPA concentration was 0.9 and 1.2 microg/ml in patients within or below C2 range, respectively (P = 0.19). CsA C2 correlated with MPAG-to-MPA ratio (P < 0.01, r = 0.91) and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT, P < 0.01, r = 0.86). Total MPA concentration increased during the 3 months, but not in patients on tacrolimus. High CsA C2 lowered the acute rejection rate and plasma MPA. High CsA C2 is associated with elevated GGT, probably because of cholestatic effects, which explain the increased MPAG-to-MPA ratio. Increasing MPA concentration is ascribed to per-protocol CsA C2 reductions. In conclusion, CsA may confound the relationship between MPA and the incidence of rejection, and contribute to the difficulty of obtaining a therapeutic range for MPA in clinical practice."

These ubiquitous fungal spores typically are inhaled and can germinate in immunocompromised hosts. Standard therapy for invasive mucormycosis includes parenteral amphotericin B (AMB) in combination with radical debridement of infected tissues. Early diagnosis and treatment are of paramount importance. Unfortunately, long-term survival is poor owing to the prohibitive morbidity and mortality rates associated with the medical and surgical therapies. Posaconazole is a novel, extended-spectrum triazole oral antifungal agent with documented success in the treatment of patients with invasive mucormycosis."

True,adverse events laboratory test abnormalities similar among patients treated pravastatin placebonan,8001304,pravastatin,laboratory test abnormalities,"This multinational, 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy and safety of low-dose pravastatin in 325 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and hypercholesterolemia [serum total cholesterol concentrations of 5.2-7.8 mmol/l (200 to 300 mg/dl)]. Patients were randomized to receive pravastatin 10 mg or matching placebo with doubling of the dose after 8 weeks if predefined target levels for total cholesterol [(i.e., < 5.2 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) or > 15% decrease from baseline] had not been achieved. At Week 16, pravastatin-treated patients showed a 21.4% decrease in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a 13.5% reduction in serum total cholesterol (TC) concentrations (p < 0.001 compared with placebo). Levels of triglycerides (TG) were reduced 9.6% during pravastatin treatment (p < 0.05 compared with placebo) while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were increased 4.4% (p = NS). Adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities were similar among patients treated with pravastatin or placebo. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels remained unchanged. The results of this study demonstrate that low-dose pravastatin is effective and well tolerated for lowering elevated cholesterol concentrations during short-term treatment of patients with NIDDM and hypercholesterolemia."

We aimed to investigate the impact of the coadministration of TZD and ACEI/ARB on hematocrit and hemoglobin values in uncomplicated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal serum creatinine.Data from patients with type 2 diabetes currently followed, were reviewed and patients treated with ACEI/ARB and/or TZD were identified. For the purpose of this study the following 4 groups of 30 stable non-anemic diabetic patients each matched for age, gender, and BMI were formed. Group ACEI/ARB included patients on ACEI/ARB without TZD, group TZD included patients on TZD and antihypertensive agents other than ACEI/ARB, group ACEI/ARB/TZD consisted of patients on combined therapy with ACEI/ARB and TZD and the control group C included patients never exposed to ACEI/ARB or TZD. Clinical and laboratory data were collected prior to initiation of treatment and after 6 months.Neither hematocrit nor hemoglobin showed any significant change from baseline at the end of the study in group C. In both group ACEI/ARB and group TZD a small, but statistically significant reduction in hematocrit (~ 1% point) and hemoglobin levels (~ 0.3 g/dl) was seen. A greater statistically and clinically important reduction in hematocrit (~ 3% points) and hemoglobin (~ 1 g/dl) levels was observed in group  ACEI/ARB/TZD. Furthermore, incident anemia at the end reached 7% in group TZD and 23% in group ACEI/ARB/TZD.Coadministration of RAS inhibitors and PPAR-γ agonists should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hematocrit lowering and anemia in uncomplicated type 2 diabetic patients with normal serum creatinine. Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism(s), the cardiovascular consequences and the cost utility of anemia workup in such patients."

True,results indicated complexation quinolinone schiff bases copper served significantly enhance cytotoxicity nan,22705894,copper,cytotoxicity,"This study determined the cytotoxic, cyto-selective and mutagenic potential of novel quinolinone Schiff base ligands and their corresponding copper(II) complexes in human-derived hepatic carcinoma cells (Hep-G2) and non-malignant human-derived hepatic cells (Chang). Results indicated that complexation of quinolinone Schiff bases with copper served to significantly enhance cytotoxicity. Here, the complex of (7E)-7-(3-ethoxy-2-hydroxybenzylideamino)-4-methylquinolin-2(1H)-one (TV117-FM) exhibited the lowest IC(50) value (17.9 μM) following 96 h continuous exposure, which was comparable to cisplatin (15.0 μM). However, results revealed that TV117-FM lacked cytoselectivity over non-malignant cells. Additionally, the complex was minimally effluxed from cells via Pglycoprotein (P-gp) and was shown to be non-mutagenic in the Standard Ames test. Furthermore, BrdU incorporation assays showed that it was capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis in a concentrationand time-dependent manner. However, inhibition was not as a consequence of DNA intercalation, as illustrated in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Interestingly, it was shown that the ligand was capable of inhibiting the action of topoisomerase II, but this was lost following complexation. This indicated that the mechanism of action of the novel copper(II) complex was different from that of the parent ligand and suggests that TV117-FM may have a therapeutic role to play in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Studies are currently underway to elucidate the exact in vitro mechanism of action of this novel, metal-based anti-cancer agent."
True,pathological lesions deposits igg mpo found immunized rats perfused mpo h2o2 without neutral protease mpo alone rat strains day day nan,8082301,H2O2,Pathological lesions,"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), including anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies, are associated with pauci-immune necrotizing small vessel vasculitis or glomerulonephritis. In order to substantiate a pathogenic role for ANCA, an animal model of pauci-immune ANCA-induced glomerulonephritis or vasculitis is required. Brouwer et al. reported pauci-immune glomerulonephritis in rats immunized with human MPO followed by perfusion of kidneys with lysosomal enzyme extract combined with H2O2, and suggested that this could serve as a model of ANCA-induced disease. We repeated these studies in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Brown Norway rats (BNR). We immunized rats with human MPO. When circulating anti-MPO antibodies were detectable by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and ELISA, blood pressure was measured, then perfusion of the left kidney of each rat was done via the renal artery in a closed, blood-free circuit with either MPO + H2O2, MPO, H2O2 alone or MPO + H2O2 + neutral protease. Rats were killed on day 4 or day 10 after perfusion, and specimens were examined by light and immunofluorescence microscopy. Pathological lesions and deposits of IgG, C3, and MPO were found in immunized rats perfused with MPO + H2O2 with or without neutral protease, or MPO alone, in both rat strains and on both day 4 and day 10. The degree of histologic injury was proportional in intensity to the amount of IgG immune deposits. Spontaneously hypertensive rats sustained more damage and higher blood pressure than Brown Norway rats. No lesion was observed in immunized rats perfused with H2O2 or in the non-perfused right kidneys. Some of the non-immunized rats perfused with MPO + H2O2 developed pathological lesions. In conclusion, these rat models are examples of immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, and therefore are not similar to human ANCA-associated disease."

False,stroke useful strategy increase availability thereby exploit beneficial antiplatelet antiatherosclerotic haemodynamic neuroprotective propertiesnan,12605567,NO,stroke,"The therapeutic modulation of the nitric oxide (NO) system has generated considerable interest as a new way for managing many disease processes. In stroke, a useful strategy is to increase NO availability and thereby exploit its beneficial antiplatelet, antiatherosclerotic, haemodynamic and neuroprotective properties. Pharmacologically, this can be achieved by providing NO substrate, using NO donors or by upregulating nitric oxide synthase. Alternatively, one can reduce NO availability by inhibiting NO synthase and thereby limiting its pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic properties. This article reviews developments in NO-related therapeutics for treatment of stroke, with a particular emphasis on compounds that are in the clinical research and development pipeline. Although the routine use of NO therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of stroke cannot currently be recommended, we are evidently at an exciting stage in their pharmacological development. Definitive randomised controlled trials in stroke patients are required as a matter of urgency."

Here we present evidence that chronic oral administration of carvedilol, a nonselective β-adrenergic receptor blocker, significantly attenuates brain oligomeric β-amyloid content and cognitive deterioration in 2 independent AD mouse models. We found that carvedilol treatment significantly improved neuronal transmission, and that this improvement was associated with the maintenance of number of the less stable ""learning"" thin spines in the brains of AD mice. Our novel observation that carvedilol interferes with the neuropathologic, biochemical, and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deterioration in AD supports the potential development of carvedilol as a treatment for AD."

Acid protease (cathepsin D) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose, whereas activities were increased equally in patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to viral hepatitis whether or not they survived. A correlation was found between serum acid protease activity and prothrombin time, and the increase in cathepsin D activity was sustained over several days compared with aspartate aminotransferase, which showed a sharp early peak and then a fall. Circulating lysosomal proteases can damage other organs, and measurement of their activity may therefore be of added value in assessing prognosis in this condition."

True,report first report enhancing effects ec curcumin data suggest ec plays significant role enhancement cancerpreventive activity curcumin dietnan,20606042,curcumin,cancer-preventive activity,"Curcumin, a phenolic compound isolated from the plant Curcuma longa (Linn), is ingested every day in the Indian subcontinent and is well reported to possess cancer-preventive activity. To achieve effective cancer prevention with curcumin, we need to find a new method to enhance the effects of curcumin in the diet. Based on our evidence that (-)-epicatechin (EC), an inert catechin, enhances the cancer-preventive activity of green tea catechins, we studied the enhancing effects of EC on inductions of growth inhibition and apoptosis in human lung cancer cell lines PC-9 and A549 with curcumin. The combination of curcumin with EC significantly increased the inhibition of cell growth compared with curcumin or EC alone. The combination similarly increased both apoptosis and expression of GADD153 and GADD45 genes, associated with their enhanced protein production. Knockdown of GADD153 or GADD45 by small interfering RNA abrogated the apoptosis induction and growth inhibition induced by the combination, indicating the crucial role of their upregulation. Treatments of PC-9 cells with c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase inhibitor SP600125, with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB202190 and with PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 inhibitor) all increased the upregulation of GADD153 and GADD45 genes by the combination. Because EC was previously shown to enhance the incorporation of EGCG into PC-9 cells, we think that EC has similar effects on curcumin. This report is the first report on the enhancing effects of EC on curcumin, and the data suggest that EC plays a significant role in the enhancement of the cancer-preventive activity of curcumin in the diet."

In many populations, high intakes of saturated fat are associated with elevated serum cholesterol concentrations and increased coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. However, several studies report that hyperlipidaemia and heart diseases are not common among populations who consume coconut, a source of saturated fat. A case-control study was conducted among the Minangkabau known to be high coconut consumers to examine the difference in food patterns and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) between the coronary cases and their gender- and age-matched apparently healthy counterparts serving as controls. Eligible subjects with CHD were identified through the co-operation of five participating hospitals located in Padang and Bukittinggi in West Sumatra, Indonesia. A total of 93 eligible cases (62 men and 31 women) in the Case group and 189 subjects (113 men and 76 women) in the Control group were recruited. Information on the intakes of individual foods and dishes over the preceding 12 months was obtained using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The Case groups had significantly higher intakes of meats, eggs, sugar, tea, coffee and fruits, but lower intakes of soy products, rice and cereals compared to the controls. Coconut consumption as flesh or milk was not different between cases and controls. The cases had significantly higher intakes of protein and cholesterol, but lower intake of carbohydrate. Similar intakes of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids between the cases and controls indicated that the consumption of total fat or saturated fat, including that from coconut, was not a predictor for CHD in this food culture. However, the intakes of animal foods, total protein, dietary cholesterol and less plant derived carbohydrates were predictors of CHD."
True,repeated topical exposure chromium(vi) may cause allergic contact dermatitis formation chrome ulcersnanmay could make third option right well,10382555,chromium(VI),allergic,"Repeated topical exposure to chromium(VI) may cause an allergic contact dermatitis or the formation of chrome ulcers. Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III)."
True,nicotine wellknown unpleasant side effects eg transient dizziness nausea nicotine induced nystagmus nin nan,17990061,Nicotine,NIN/nicotine-induced nystagmus,"Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness."

A number of structures, e.g. 4b, 7a, 7e, 13a, and 21-25, were superior to dazoxiben 26 as inhibitors of TXA2 synthase in in vitro ADP-induced aggregation experiments with human blood platelets. The TXA2 synthase inhibitory activity was confirmed by measurement of the prostanoid metabolites derived from 14C-labeled arachidonic acid. Three compounds (7a, 7e, and 25) demonstrated in vitro inhibition of human platelet cAMP PDE at micromolar concentrations in conjunction with their TXA2 synthase inhibitory activity. Synergistic enhancement of antiaggregatory and antithrombotic actions was expected when simultaneous stimulation of adenylate cyclase (through increased PGI2 production) and inhibition of platelet cAMP PDE were possible from the same compound. Ex vivo and in vivo experiments were conducted in rats and mice, respectively, to evaluate the effects of compounds 7e and 23 on platelet aggregation and thrombotic events within these animals. Compound 7e, which has a comparable level of TXA2 synthase (IC50 1.2 microM) and human platelet cAMP PDE (IC50 6.4 microM) inhibitory activities, was found to be orally bioavailable with a long duration of action and offered effective protection against mortality in a collagen-epinephrine-induced pulmonary thromboembolism model in mice. Significant blood pressure and heart rate effects were observed for several compounds, e.g. 7e, 9e, 13a, 13d, 18, 20, 21, and 23, when dosed orally in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats."

We investigated the hypothesis that, as in some other large human arteries, 5-HT-induced contraction of the temporal artery is mediated through two co-existing receptor populations, 5-HT1-like- and 5-HT2A. Temporal arterial segments were obtained from patients undergoing brain surgery and rings prepared set up to contract with 5-HT and related agents. Fractions of maximal 5-HT responses mediated through 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2A receptors, f1 and f2 = 1-f1, were estimated by use of the 5-HT2A-selective antagonist ketanserin. 2. In rings with intact endothelium 5-HT evoked contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.0. Ketanserin (10-1000 nM) antagonized part of the 5-HT-induced contractions. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M of 6.9 and f1 of 0.17 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 6.4 and f1 of 0.20 (1000 nM ketanserin). 3. In rings with endothelial function attenuated by enzymatic treatment, 5-HT caused contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.2 that were partially blocked by ketanserin. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M 7.4 and f1 of 0.16 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 7.5 and f1 of 0.14 (1000 nM ketanserin). 4. The ketanserin-resistant component of 5-HT-evoked contraction was blocked by methiothepin (100-1000 nM) consistent with mediation through 5-HT1-like receptors. 5. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT1-like-selective agonist, sumatriptan, caused small contractions with a -log EC50, M of 6.5 and intrinsic activity of 0.21 with respect to 5-HT that were resistant to blockade by 1000 nM ketanserin but antagonized by 100 nM methiothepin. 6. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT2A receptor partial agonist SK&F 103829 (2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-8[methyl sulphonyl]-1H3-benzazepin-7-ol methensulphonate) contracted rings with a -log EC50, M of 5.0 and an intrinsic activity of 0.49 with respect to 5-HT; the effects were antagonized by ketanserin 1000 nM. 7. We conclude that 80-86% of the maximum 5-HT-evoked contraction of human temporal artery is mediated through 5-HT2A receptors, the remainder through 5-HT1-like-receptors, regardless of whether or not endothelium is functional. The 5-HT1-like-receptors are more likely to be 5-HT1D beta receptors than 5-HT1D alpha receptors and sumatriptan is a full agonist for these receptors. As found in arteries of other species, SK&F 103829 is a partial agonist for 5-HT2A receptors of human temporal artery."

False,molecular mechanisms potentially responsible cadmium induced cell transformation tumorigenesis investigated using balbct cells transformed cadmium chloridenan,11711542,cadmium,tumorigenesis,"The molecular mechanisms potentially responsible for cadmium-induced cell transformation and tumorigenesis were investigated using Balb/c-3T3 cells transformed with cadmium chloride. Differential display analysis of gene expression revealed consistent and reproducible overexpression of a transcript in the transformed cells compared with the nontransformed cells. The full-length cDNA corresponding to the differentially expressed transcript was cloned and was identified as mouse translation elongation factor-1 delta subunit (TEF-1 delta; GenBank accession number ). Nucleotide sequence analysis of TEF-1 delta cDNA revealed an open reading frame encoding the predicted protein of 281 amino acids and exhibited significant conservation with the corresponding protein of human, Xenopus laevis, and Artemia. The presence of a leucine zipper motif, characteristic of translation elongation factor-1 delta, was also found in the mouse TEF-1 delta. A 31-kDa protein was detected in eukaryotic cells transfected with an expression vector containing the TEF-1 delta cDNA. Overexpression of the TEF-1 delta protein by transfection was oncogenic in NIH3T3 cells as evidenced by the appearance of transformed foci exhibiting anchorage-independent growth and the potential to grow as tumors in nude mice. Blocking the translation of TEF-1 delta with antisense TEF-1 delta mRNA resulted in a significant reversal of the oncogenic potential of cadmium-transformed Balb/c-3T3 cells as evidenced from suppression in anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis in nude mice. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that the cell transformation and tumorigenesis induced by cadmium are due, at least in part, to the overexpression of TEF-1 delta, a novel cadmium-responsive proto-oncogene."
False,hepcidin inhibits function fpn iron exporter leading iron overloaded inside ferritins splenic cells stained abnormal hemosiderin accumulationnan,20540689,iron,splenic,"Cisplatin is one of the commonly-used chemotherapeutic drugs to efficiently treat malignant tumors in clinic, however, the adverse effects of cisplatin such as nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and hemolytic uremic syndrome are often observed at its clinical doses (approximately 60 mg/m(2)), which limit its broader application. In earlier studies, little attention was paid to the subtle changes in the architecture of lymphatic organs after low doses of cisplatin treatment. This paper reviews current understanding of cisplatin-induced erythrocyte injury, and presents our latest finding that a low dose of cisplatin (3.6 mg/m(2)/day, 14 days) could induce specific hemosiderin deposition in spleen of both normal and hepatoma-22 (H22) inoculated Balb/C mice. This dose of cisplatin significantly inhibited H22-induced acute ascites development. No significant toxicity was induced by this dose of cisplatin to tissues except for hemosiderin accumulation in the spleen of both normal and H22 tumor-bearing mice. Increased splenic iron content and erythrocyte injury were observed after treatment with the low dose of cisplatin. The mRNA levels of ferroportin (FPN1) and ferritin were upregulated by 25 and 5-fold in spleen, respectively. Overexpression of FPN1 and ferritin protein were also been observed at protein levels by Western blotting analysis. In addition, the mRNA expression of hepcidin was also increased, suggesting blockage of iron recycling through FPN1 in spleen with cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, cisplatin treatment damages the erythrocytes which accumulate in the red pulp of spleen with defective recycling of FPN1 and ferritin protein. Hepcidin inhibits the function of FPN1 as iron-exporter leading to iron overloaded inside ferritins of splenic cells, which are stained with abnormal hemosiderin accumulation. These results demonstrate that cisplatin-caused hemosiderin deposition in spleen provides a valuable clue for understanding the molecular basis of toxicity of cisplatin and hemosiderin accumulation and iron metabolism in vivo."
False,thymidylate synthase ts regarded parameter 5-fluorouracil 5-fu chemosensitivity colorectal carcinomanan,10791849,5-FU/5-fluorouracil,Thymidylate synthase/TS,Thymidylate synthase (TS) is regarded as a parameter of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemosensitivity for colorectal carcinoma. Recent researchers indicate that the chemosensitivity of 5-FU for colorectal carcinoma with low expression of TS is better than tumors with high expression of TS. But the relation between TS expression and overall survival of curatively resected colorectal cancer patients has been less studied.
True,acute reversible cumulative peripheral sensory neuropathy observed frequently oxaliplatin treatment limits usenan,12398998,oxaliplatin,peripheral sensory neuropathy,"Oxaliplatin, a platinum compound characterized by a diaminocyclohexane (DACH) platinum carrier ligand, has proven its efficacy in first- and second-line advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. Acute reversible and cumulative peripheral sensory neuropathy has been observed frequently with oxaliplatin treatment and limits its use. Its synergism with other drugs, as well as its different mechanism of action and toxicity profile make it an attractive candidate for combination studies in CRC. It can be combined safely with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)+/-folinic acid (LV), irinotecan, raltitrexed, multitarget antifolate LY231514 (MTA), and oral 5-FU prodrugs. These combinations confer both an increased response rate compared to that of any single agent and an increased secondary surgical resection of initially unresectable metastases, possibly leading to prolonged survival. In three prospective randomized phase III studies in advanced CRC, oxaliplatin plus 5-FU/LV improved significantly progression-free survival without a significant increase in median survival time and without affecting quality of life, compared to treatment with 5-FU/LV. Ongoing clinical trials will define its role in the adjuvant setting."

We report our experience with long-term sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim therapy in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. We describe recent advances in the pathogenesis of Wegener's granulomatosis, suggest a complementary mechanism of action of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and advocate long-term sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim therapy as a treatment option in Wegener's granulomatosis."
True,risperidone associated benign transient visual disturbances schizophrenic patients past history lsd abusenan,12013711,Risperidone,visual disturbances,"Two schizophrenic patients, who had a prior history of LSD abuse and who had previously developed EPS with classic antipsychotics, were successfully treated with risperidone. They both reported short episodes of transient visual disturbances, which appeared immediately after starting treatment with risperidone. This imagery resembled visual disturbances previously experienced as ""flashbacks"" related to prior LSD consumption. Risperidone administration was continued and the visual disturbances gradually wore off. During a six-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of visual disturbances. This phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign, short-term and self-limiting side effect which does not contraindicate the use of risperidone or interfere with treatment. Conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution."
True,apparent calcium chloride dissociate vocalization fighting autonomic motor phenomena mydriasis tremor clonictonic convulsions caused carbachol eserine nan,6892185,eserine,clonic-tonic convulsions,"The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system."

True,symptoms hypothyroidism occur patients treated sorafenib due metastatic renal cell carcinomanan,22933166,sorafenib,hypothyroidism,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are relatively new targeted therapy drugs used for the treatment of metastatic clear cell kidney carcinoma, gastrointestinal  stromal tumours, thyroid carcinoma and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours during the progression of the disease. Hypothyroidism  or thyroid dysfunction is often a side effect of this treatment. Therefore, monitoring of thyroid hormone levels before the beginning  and during the treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is a necessity. Hypothyroidism correlates with objective response to the treatment.  Sunitinib. This is the most described tyrosine kinase inhibitor which causes hypothyroidism. The mechanism of hypothyroidism is still unclear.  Sorafenib. Symptoms of hypothyroidism occur in 18% of patients treated with sorafenib due to metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  Imatinib. Hypothyroidism is one of the most frequent side effects of the treatment. Emergent tracheotomy was necessary due to larynx  swelling during marked hypothyroidism.  Motesanib. Hypothyroidism or increased TSH level is diagnosed in 22% to 69% of patients with metastatic differentiated or medullary  thyroid carcinomas. The management of patients with thyroid dysfunction and related symptoms such as fatigue is undoubtedly a challenge  to an oncologist."

False,diclofenac paracetamol analgesia paediatric myringotomy outpatientsnan,11939442,Diclofenac,analgesia,"This prospective, randomized, double-blind study compared the analgesic efficacy of oral diclofenac resinate 0.5 mg.kg(-1) with paracetamol 15 mg/kg(-1) for control of postoperative pain in paediatric patients for outpatient bilateral myringotomy and tube insertion. Paracetamol, the most commonly used oral analgesic for paediatric patients, was compared with a new palatable syrup formulation of diclofenac. Sixty-three ASA 1 orA SA 2 children aged one year and above were randomly assigned to receive diclofenac (Group A) or paracetamol (Group B). The study drug was given 30 to 60 minutes before induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with either inhalational sevoflurane or intravenous thiopentone. All subjects received intravenous fentanyl 1 microg/kg(-1) intraoperatively. Postoperative pain was assessed by a blinded observer using the CHEOPS score on eye-opening, and then at 10, 30 and 60 minutes. Children with a CHEOPS score > 7 received further fentanyl 1 microg x kg(-1). The number of cases requiring this ""rescue"" analgesia was recorded. Both groups were comparable in demographics, induction technique, duration of anaesthesia and time between premedication and induction of anaesthesia. Overall, CHEOPS scores were low for both groups at all times and did not differ between the groups at any time. Twenty per cent of the diclofenac group and 27% of the paracetamol group required rescue analgesia (not statistically significant). The efficacy of diclofenac 0.5 mg x kg(-1) and paracetamol 15 mg x kg(-1) as oral analgesic premedication for BMT was comparable in children receiving an anaesthetic which included intraoperative administration of fentanyl 1 microg x kg(-1)."

True,consists microangiopathic hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia progressive renal failure associated mitomycin treatment affects patients treated agentnan,3108839,mitomycin C,renal failure,"Mitomycin C associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised. It consists of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with mitomycin C treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent. The renal failure usually develops about 8-10 mth after start of mitomycin C treatment and the mortality is approximately 60% from renal failure or pulmonary edema. Renal lesions are similar to those seen in idiopathic HUS and include arteriolar fibrin thrombi, expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls, ischemic wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis. The mechanism of action is postulated as mitomycin C-induced endothelial cell damage. We describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr-old man with gastric adenocarcinoma who developed renal failure and thrombocytopenia while on treatment with mitomycin C and died in pulmonary edema."
False,diet assessed ffq blood collected analysis serum highsensitivity creactive protein hscrp il serum amyloid eselectin lipid profile dietary biomarkers carotenoids tocopherols retinolnan,25313576,tocopherols,carotenoids,"Dietary modification may affect inflammatory processes and protect against chronic disease. In the present study, we examined the relationship between dietary patterns, circulating carotenoid and tocopherol concentrations, and biomarkers of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation in a 10-year longitudinal study of Scottish postmenopausal women. Diet was assessed by FFQ during 1997-2000 (n 3237, mean age 54·8 (SD 2·2) years). Participants (n 2130, mean age 66·0 (SD 2·2) years) returned during 2007-11 for follow-up. Diet was assessed by FFQ (n 1682) and blood was collected for the analysis of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), IL-6, serum amyloid A, E-selectin, lipid profile and dietary biomarkers (carotenoids, tocopherols and retinol). Dietary pattern and dietary biomarker (serum carotenoid) components were generated by principal components analysis. A past 'prudent' dietary pattern predicted serum concentrations of hs-CRP and IL-6 (which decreased across the quintiles of the dietary pattern; P= 0·002 and P= 0·001, respectively; ANCOVA). Contemporary dietary patterns were also associated with inflammatory biomarkers. The concentrations of hs-CRP and IL-6 decreased across the quintiles of the 'prudent' dietary pattern (P= 0·030 and P= 0·006, respectively). hs-CRP concentration increased across the quintiles of a 'meat-dominated' dietary pattern (P= 0·001). Inflammatory biomarker concentrations decreased markedly across the quintiles of carotenoid component score (P< 0·001 for hs-CRP and IL-6, and P= 0·016 for E-selectin; ANCOVA). Prudent dietary pattern and carotenoid component scores were negatively associated with serum hs-CRP concentration (unstandardised β for prudent component: -0·053, 95% CI -0·102, -0·003; carotenoid component: -0·183, 95% CI -0·233, -0·134) independent of study covariates. A prudent dietary pattern (which reflects a diet high in the intakes of fish, yogurt, pulses, rice, pasta and wine, in addition to fruit and vegetable consumption) and a serum carotenoid profile characteristic of a fruit and vegetable-rich diet are associated with lower concentrations of intermediary markers that are indicative of CVD risk reduction."
